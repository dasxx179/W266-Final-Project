    "# Test Dataset Scraping and Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we pull the test dataset from the New York Times interviews of the Democratic Candidates. We will also be pulling a Trump tweet dataset to see an example of views on the other end of the political spectrum. After running scrape_test, we manually delete the beginning and ending rows in the output CSV that correspond to formatting. The next function, address_short_strings, puts strings smaller than 50 characters into the previous row to provide additional context. This result goes in cavndidatename_cleaned.csv (raw data is in candidate.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we may consolidate all the rows into one single record for testing. That is an option we can run at testing time. We may opt to run each of these records separately and do post processing to get the maximum value for a label over all records for a given candidate (since not all rows will contain information about all issues). This may help with ensuring models such as RNNs do not \"forget\" about certain topics in earlier sections of the passage."
