7 WAYS IMMIGRANTS ENRICH OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY FACT: IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE TO JOB CREATION.,pro-immigration
"A report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found little to no effect on the wages and employment of native-born workers in the long-term by undocumented immigrants.",pro-immigration
Immigrants are also entrepreneurs who create jobs.,pro-immigration
"According to a study of the bipartisan immigration bill passed in the Senate in 2014, provisions in the bill could potentially bring between 336,000 and 470,000 undocumented immigrant entrepreneurs into the formal economy.",pro-immigration
"Given that the average immigrant-owned business hires 11 employees, these businesses would account for between 3.7 million and 5.2 million jobs in the formal economy.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants Aren't Taking Americans' Jobs, New Study Finds Immigration Helps American Workers’ Wages and Job Opportunities FACT: UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE PAYING TAXES.",pro-immigration
Undocumented immigrants pay an average of $11.64 billion in state and local taxes a year.,pro-immigration
"On average, an undocumented individual has about 8% of their income go to taxes.",pro-immigration
"Moreover, all immigrants—regardless of status—will contribute approximately $80,000 more in taxes than government services used over their lifetime.",pro-immigration
Undocumented Immigrants’ State and Local Tax Contributions FACT: IMMIGRANTS ARE HELPING TO SUSTAIN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND.,pro-immigration
"In 2010, undocumented individuals paid $13 billion into retirement accounts and only received $1 billion in return.",pro-immigration
"Indeed, over the years, immigrants have contributed up to $300 billion to the Social Security Trust Fund.",pro-immigration
"Without the contributions of immigrants going into the system, it is estimated that full benefits would not be able to be paid out beyond the year 2037.",pro-immigration
The Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes 5 Immigration Myths Debunked FACT: THE NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS REMAINED THE SAME IN RECENT YEARS.,pro-immigration
"In 2014, there were 11 million undocumented individuals in the United States.",pro-immigration
"This number has remained unchanged from 2009, and represents a decline from 12.2 million undocumented individuals who resided in the United States in 2007.",pro-immigration

FACT: DACA RECIPIENTS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ECONOMY.,pro-immigration
"DACA recipients—people who came to the United States at a young age and applied for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—paid a $465 fee with their applications, meaning that the program has not cost taxpayers a single cent.",pro-immigration
"Since the program began in 2012, more than 750,000 individuals have had their applications for DACA approved—and the U.S. economy has benefitted.",pro-immigration
The cost of ending the DACA program would eliminate at least $433.4 billion from the GDP over the course of a decade.,pro-immigration

FACT: IMMIGRATION REFORM WOULD REDUCE THE DEFICIT.,pro-immigration
"According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan immigration bill that passed in the Senate in 2014 would have helped reduce the deficit by $197 billion, increased investment by 2%, and increased overall employment by 3.5% by the year 2023.",pro-immigration
The Economic Benefits of Immigration FACT: IMMIGRANTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES THAN NATIVE-BORN AMERICANS.,pro-immigration
Studies have confirmed that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans and they are associated with lower crime rates.,pro-immigration
"Additionally, in counties that have put in place policies to limit cooperation with immigration enforcement and to uphold the Fourth Amendment, there are lower crime rates than in counties without “sanctuary policies.”",pro-immigration
NEW EVIDENCE THAT IMMIGRATION IS GOOD FOR AMERICA Counties where more immigrants settled a century ago have stronger economies today.,pro-immigration
"Immigration has become the signature issue of the Trump administration, and is likely to be a major focus of the 2020 election.",pro-immigration
Debates persist over whether an influx of newcomers to the nation represents a boon or a burden.,pro-immigration
"Well, let's check the historical record.",pro-immigration
"The United States experienced the effects of mass migration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and many of the fears expressed today were heard, and felt, then.",pro-immigration
So how did that experiment work out a century later?,pro-immigration
"Quite well, it turns out.",pro-immigration
"New research reports that U.S. counties that saw more immigration between 1850 and 1920 today enjoy higher average incomes, less poverty, and lower unemployment.",pro-immigration
"""Our findings suggest that the long-run benefits of immigration can be large, and need not come at high social cost,"" reports a research team led by Sandra Sequeira of the London School of Economics.",pro-immigration
"""These benefits can be realized quickly, and are highly persistent.""",pro-immigration
"In the Review of Economic Studies, the researchers look at the long-term economic and social effects of the largest immigration wave in American history, one that changed the nation's ethnic make-up.",pro-immigration
"""While prior immigrants were primarily from Western Europe,"" they write, ""the new wave also included large numbers of immigrants from Southern, Northern, and Eastern Europe.""",pro-immigration
"These immigrants did not settle uniformly across the country; upon arrival, they usually traveled by rail to their eventual destinations.",pro-immigration
"""If a county was connected to the railway network during periods of high aggregate immigration to the U.S., [it] tended to receive more immigrants,"" the researchers note.",pro-immigration
Their analysis finds that these counties enjoyed enormous long-term benefits.,pro-immigration
"""Historical immigration resulted in significantly higher incomes, less poverty, less unemployment, more urbanization, and higher educational attainment today,"" they write.",pro-immigration
"To cite one specific figure: On average, a county that experienced an average rate of immigration during this period enjoys 13 percent higher per-capita income today than one that did not host any new immigrants.",pro-immigration
"""Immigrants first contributed to the establishment of more manufacturing facilities, and then to the development of larger facilities,"" the researchers report.",pro-immigration
"""We also found large positive effects on agricultural productivity and innovation, as measured by patenting rates.""",pro-immigration
"OK, but did that growth come at the cost of a more fractured society?",pro-immigration
"Perhaps, the researchers report, but any fracturing didn't last long.",pro-immigration
"""We find no evidence that historical immigration affects social cohesion, as measured by social capital (that is, shared norms, trust, and cooperation), voter turnout, or crime rates,"" they write.",pro-immigration
Their findings confirm a longstanding historical narrative that seems to have been forgotten.,pro-immigration
"""The less-skilled immigrants provided the labor force necessary for industrial development,"" Sequeira and her colleagues write.",pro-immigration
"""A smaller number of immigrants brought with them knowledge, skills, and know-how that were beneficial for industry and increased productivity in agriculture.""",pro-immigration
"Thanks to that beneficial combination, ""immigration led to early industrial development and long-run prosperity, which continues to persist until today.""",pro-immigration
"Something to think about the next time you hear a nativist news commentator rail that increasing legal immigration ""would advance the interests of the global elite ahead of our citizens.""",pro-immigration
Such statements reflect a willful ignorance of American history.,pro-immigration
"Immigration makes America great Current policy could be improved, but American progress depends on welcoming foreigners.",pro-immigration
The Trump administration announced Monday a long-rumored regulatory change designed to make it easier to deny entry to the country to potential immigrants who are likely to earn low wages and potentially be eligible for social safety net programs.,pro-immigration
"This is part and parcel of a broad Trump-era crackdown against immigration of all kinds — record-low refugee resettlement numbers, clampdowns on asylum-seekers, tighter rules for high-tech guest workers, fewer student visas, fewer work permits for spouses of legal immigrants, and a legislative proposal that would cut legal immigration levels in half.",pro-immigration
It’s a vision that stands in stark contrast to the immigration stance of George Washington who embraced a vision for an open America that could almost be read today as a form of deep idealism or altruism.,pro-immigration
"“America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions,” he told newly arrived Irishmen in 1783.",pro-immigration
"He assured them they’d be “welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges, if by decency and propriety of conduct they appear to merit the enjoyment.”  But Washington’s vision wasn’t primarily about charity or helping others.",pro-immigration
It was about building the kind of country that he wanted the United States to become.,pro-immigration
Greatness would require great people.,pro-immigration
America would need more than it had.,pro-immigration
"The contemporary debate around immigration is often framed around an axis of selfishness versus generosity, with Donald Trump talking about the need to put “America first” while opponents tell heartbreaking stories of deportations and communities torn apart.",pro-immigration
A debate about how to enforce the existing law tends to supersede discussion of what the law ought to say.,pro-immigration
All of this misses the core point.,pro-immigration
"Immigration to the United States has not, historically, been an act of kindness toward strangers.",pro-immigration
It’s been a strategy for national growth and national greatness.,pro-immigration
Washington and his fellow founders could have established America as a kind of exclusive club.,pro-immigration
The present-day United States undoubtedly would still be a prosperous and pleasant nation.,pro-immigration
"But our cities would be smaller, our global influence would be reduced, and many fewer of the world’s cutting-edge companies would be based here.",pro-immigration
"We would suffer, as small countries tend to, from our talented and ambitious young people seeking their fortunes in bigger places abroad.",pro-immigration
"With many fewer people, it wouldn’t be the great nation it is today.",pro-immigration
"While a lot has changed since Washington’s time, two fundamentals have not.",pro-immigration
The United States is still a country with a mission and a desire for greatness on the world stage.,pro-immigration
And America’s openness to people who want to move here and make a better life for themselves is fuel for that greatness.,pro-immigration
Few of our problems can be solved by curtailing immigration.,pro-immigration
Many could be solved by welcoming more foreigners to our shores.,pro-immigration
"The main sources of immigration — and the main occupations likely to employ immigrants — have changed over time, but the story has been the same from the beginning.",pro-immigration
"A larger and more diverse population supports more intensive development of the resources available and a more complex division of labor, leading, over time, to a steadily more sophisticated and prosperous national economy.",pro-immigration
A lone person on an island by himself will struggle to get by even if he is surrounded by natural abundance.,pro-immigration
A small band would live at a subsistence level.,pro-immigration
"To achieve true affluence, people need to be able to specialize and trade with one another.",pro-immigration
"To an extent in the modern world, that means access to global markets — grain can be shipped to Europe and timber to Japan.",pro-immigration
"But for most people, it means direct access to other people, who serve as customers and co-workers and suppliers.",pro-immigration
"Lionel Fontagné and Gianluca Santoni find that heavily populated areas offer higher labor productivity and higher pay because “denser commuting zones seem to offer a better match between employers and employees.” The more people there are around, the more different kinds of businesses you can have and the more finely specialized they can be, meaning it’s more likely that any given person will be well-suited to work at someplace or other that’s in town.",pro-immigration
"This is in some ways most obvious at the routine retail level — big cities have specialty shops and very focused restaurants rather than general stores and generic diners — but research by Jason Abel, Ishita Dey, and Todd Gabe finds that the positive impact on density on productivity is especially true in knowledge-intensive industries.",pro-immigration
"Those findings are not immigration-specific, but the beginning of wisdom on immigration policy is that immigrants are people.",pro-immigration
"And, indeed, when you take the foreigner element out of it, most people correctly grasp that depopulation is not an economic growth strategy.",pro-immigration
"Texans — often especially the most conservative ones — brag about how many people move there from other states, fueling the growth of dynamic metropolitan economies.",pro-immigration
"When people have children, it, of course, imposes a short-term cost on the local educational system.",pro-immigration
But it also builds the long-term future of the national community.,pro-immigration
"By the same token, there is a fairly firm consensus that immigration raises incomes on average for native-born workers.",pro-immigration
"When the University of Chicago’s Booth School surveyed a panel of well-known academic economists, for example, 52 percent agreed that admitting more low-skilled immigrants to the United States would make the average US citizen better off.",pro-immigration
Just 9 percent disagreed.,pro-immigration
The panel agreed that more highly skilled immigrants would be good by an even more overwhelming 89-0 margin.,pro-immigration
"This is not, incidentally, because an increase in the labor supply has no adverse effects for anyone.",pro-immigration
"Rather, as Heidi Shierholz of the liberal Economic Policy Institute emphasizes in her overview of the literature, it’s that “earlier immigrants are the group that’s most adversely affected by immigration” because they are the people whose skill sets are most likely to put them in direct competition with new immigrants.",pro-immigration
"Across a range of estimates, the effects on wages “tend to be very small, and on average, modestly positive.”  That’s because, as Michael Greenstone and Adam Looney of the center-left Hamilton Project put it, “immigrants and U.S.-born workers generally do not compete for the same jobs; instead, many immigrants complement the work of U.S. employees and increase their productivity.”  If a bunch of new monolingual Spanish-speaking construction laborers move to town, in other words, that probably is bad news for the monolingual Spanish-speaking construction laborers — mostly immigrants — who are already there.",pro-immigration
"But the presence of those laborers in town will create job opportunities for people to manage them, likely native-born workers who speak English.",pro-immigration
"And by increasing the number of construction projects that are undertaken, they increase the demand for more skilled tradespeople — plumbers, electricians, and others whose work is complementary to that of more generic laborers.",pro-immigration
This idea plays a critical architectural role in holding together the political coalition of contemporary conservatism — selling the idea that tax cutting is compatible with financial support for the elderly because there will be plenty of money for everyone once we get rid of the foreign-born leeches.,pro-immigration
But it’s completely false.,pro-immigration
"Unauthorized workers receive few if any public services (they ride the bus, but they’re ineligible for social assistance programs) but contribute to the tax base.",pro-immigration
"Indeed, since people living and working in the United States illegally are often paying Social Security taxes without collecting benefits, they are in some ways the great heroes of the US Treasury.",pro-immigration
"For the immigrant population at large, the best research on the fiscal impact of immigration comes from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which concluded that over the course of a 75-year time horizon, “the fiscal impacts of immigrants are generally positive at the federal level and generally negative at the state and local level.” Immigrants, in other words, pay more to the federal government in taxes than they receive in benefits, while the reverse is true for state and local governments.",pro-immigration
"This adverse impact on state and local governments is important, and derives largely from the fact that immigrants have kids who end up needing to go to school.",pro-immigration
"The good news is that those kids grow up to be second-generation adults who “contribute the most of any generation to the bottom line of state balance sheets.”  The bigger picture is that the long-run structure of the American welfare state, which is heavily focused on providing health care and retirement security to the elderly, requires a growing population and economy.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants contribute to both goals, directly through their presence in the country and indirectly by raising children.",pro-immigration
"Indeed, it’s striking that even an immigration skeptic like George Borjas concedes that immigrants grow the economy and do not personally obtain 100 percent of the benefits of that growth — meaning their presence increases the overall level of resources available to the native population.",pro-immigration
"“We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests,” he told a joint session of Congress.",pro-immigration
"To the extent that you want to whip people into an anti-immigrant fervor, it’s a good idea.",pro-immigration
"There are millions of foreign-born people in the United States, and naturally every day some of them are caught committing crimes.",pro-immigration
"Indeed, because immigrants are younger on average than native-born Americans, they commit a somewhat disproportionate share of crime.",pro-immigration
"Pew Pew Research Center But as Bianca Bersani of the University of Massachusetts has shown, on a year-by-year basis, young immigrants are much less likely to be involved in criminal activity.",pro-immigration
"Indeed, the great trajectory of immigration and crime is that second-generation youth — kids whose parents were born abroad — largely assimilate to US behavior norms rather than maintaining the better behavior of their foreign-born parents.",pro-immigration
"“Born and socialized in the U.S. mainstream,” Bersani writes, “second-generation immigrants are simply native-born youth.”   There is a very real social problem of youth crime in the United States — especially because the widespread availability of guns makes American crime much deadlier than crime in Europe or Asia — but immigrants contribute to it only in the sense that they add to the overall population.",pro-immigration
"On a per-person basis, immigrants are better-behaved than natives and immigrants’ kids are worse-behaved than their parents because they learn to act more like Americans.",pro-immigration
"Immigration-skeptical experts are rare and eccentric No issue in economics is entirely unanimous, and because immigration is a contentious issue in partisan politics, it sometimes leads the media to overplay the extent of expert disagreement about the economics of immigration.",pro-immigration
"Consequently, the work of George Borjas, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who has produced the bulk of the research dissenting from the optimistic consensus, tends to play an outsize role in the media landscape.",pro-immigration
"His work, summarized for an expert audience in his 2014 book Immigration Economics and for a popular audience in his 2016 book We Wanted Workers, is an outlier in both its conclusions and its methodology.",pro-immigration
"One big difference, as UC Berkeley’s David Card and UC Davis’s Giovanni Peri point out in their review of Immigration Economics, comes down to the annoying technical question of how you should measure the number of immigrants in a given labor market.",pro-immigration
"A naive way to make the case for immigration would be to do something like note that the list of states with the smallest foreign-born population is led by West Virginia and also includes Mississippi, Kentucky, and Alabama in the bottom 10.",pro-immigration
"Immigrant-heavy states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Massachusetts are much more prosperous.",pro-immigration
"Census Bureau The problem here, of course, is that while it’s possible that West Virginia is so poor because no foreigners move there, it’s equally likely that no foreigners move to West Virginia precisely because it’s poor.",pro-immigration
"A reasonable economic study needs to look at change over time, in both the number of immigrants and labor market outcomes for the native-born.",pro-immigration
Most researchers do this by studying the correlation between the change in the number of immigrants and outcomes for the native-born.,pro-immigration
"What Borjas studies, instead, is the change in the immigrant share of the labor force and outcomes for the native-born.",pro-immigration
Card and Peri argue that this essentially overcorrects for the West Virginia problem.,pro-immigration
"If lots of immigrants move somewhere (to, say, Texas), and that increases the demand for native-born workers, thus inducing a lot of native-born Americans to also move there, Borjas would say that doesn’t count as an example of immigration boosting the economy, because the immigrant share of the local labor force didn’t rise.",pro-immigration
"If you switch to measuring the raw number of immigrants, the bad labor market outcomes he finds disappears.",pro-immigration
"As Noah Smith writes, “the weight of evidence is against Borjas, and many of his methods also tend to look a bit shaky when subjected to careful scrutiny.” If you have some freestanding non-economic reason to want to limit immigration and want to convince yourself it’s also a good idea in economic terms, those ideas are out there.",pro-immigration
"Similarly, if you’re a politician who’s convinced your constituents want you to vote for fewer immigrants and are casting around for a good reason, Borjas is there for you to cite.",pro-immigration
But his findings are outliers based on an unusual methodology.,pro-immigration
"Immigration enriches culture and expands options Wages are easy to measure, so many studies focus on them for the sake of methodological simplicity.",pro-immigration
"But there is more to life than cash wages, and studies show that immigration has significant indirect benefits.",pro-immigration
"One example is what Michael Clemens, Ethan Lewis, and Hannah Postel found when they looked at what happened in the 1960s when the United States decided to eliminate Mexican guest workers from America’s agricultural labor force.",pro-immigration
"These guest workers, called braceros, were heavily present in some states, like Texas and California.",pro-immigration
"Other states, such as Georgia and Wisconsin, had a few braceros.",pro-immigration
Some had no braceros whatsoever.,pro-immigration
"By comparing wage trends in high-exposure, low-exposure, and no-exposure states, they were able to show that kicking out the guest workers had no real impact on farm wages.",pro-immigration
"Clemens, Lewis, and Postel That doesn’t mean the laws of supply and demand were magically repealed.",pro-immigration
It means that landowners changed their strategy.,pro-immigration
"For some crops, like tomatoes and sugar beets, producers were able to switch to more mechanical harvesting techniques — compromising on quality in the case of tomatoes.",pro-immigration
"For other crops — including asparagus, fresh strawberries, lettuce, celery, and cucumbers, for example — mechanization techniques were not available, and production simply fell.",pro-immigration
"Wages did not rise; instead, Americans learned to live with reduced produce variety.",pro-immigration
This same variety impact exists on the retail and service side of the economy as well.,pro-immigration
If you visit a place with few immigrants from Mexico — France or Fargo or what have you — you don’t find that taqueria workers are earning vastly more money than their counterparts in Texas.,pro-immigration
You find that there are few good places to buy tacos.,pro-immigration
"This isn’t the end of the world, any more than an asparagus shortage would be an acute social crisis, but that’s exactly why eliminating foreign-born workers doesn’t boost wages.",pro-immigration
People simply make do without the variety that immigrants provide.,pro-immigration
Peri and co-author Gianmarco Ottaviano find that the value of increased cultural diversity of this sort can be partially measured through higher housing values in more diverse cities — people are willing to pay more for the amenity value of ethnic food — but will miss the extent to which a nationally rising tide lifts all boats.,pro-immigration
"The debate is about immigrants, not skills A common rhetorical move in the United States is to argue that the problem with the current American system is that green card issuance depends too heavily on having relatives in the United States, rather than on having a job offer or labor market skills.",pro-immigration
"The Trump administration has taken to calling the alternative, which they feel to be in place in Canada and Australia, a “merit-based” system.",pro-immigration
"This “merit” language is, for starters, an incredibly offensive and reductive way to think about human beings.",pro-immigration
"Indeed, one suspects that Trumpniks would be the first to object if I were to refer to the Republican Party’s base of whites without college degrees as lacking “merit.”  What is true is that since people with more degrees — and especially people with degrees in technical subjects — earn above-average incomes, highly educated immigrants have a more positive budgetary impact than less educated ones.",pro-immigration
"Altering American immigration policy to put more weight on in-demand skills, educational credentials, and ability to either attract above-market salaries or work in a field where expanding the size of the workforce is deemed socially desirable is a perfectly reasonable proposal.",pro-immigration
"At the same time, it would be a mistake to see this as the genuine core of the contemporary immigration debate.",pro-immigration
"Back in 2013, for example, Rep. Darryl Issa (R-CA) introduced the SKILLS Act, which would have limited the existing “diversity visa” program and replaced it with a skills-based program that would have increased the total number of immigrants in the United States.",pro-immigration
"The Congressional Budget Office score confirms that shifting policy in this direction is a fiscal winner, but no Democrats would support SKILLS, viewing it as a poison bill designed to undermine the then-ongoing quest for comprehensive immigration reform.",pro-immigration
"More tellingly, it only had 22 co-sponsors in the House, and even though it passed the Judiciary Committee, it was never brought to the floor for a vote.",pro-immigration
"It was not reintroduced in the next Congress, nor has it been reintroduced this Congress.",pro-immigration
"The Trump administration, meanwhile, is already acting to curtail guest worker visas for skilled technical workers.",pro-immigration
"Steve Bannon, who appears to be the administration’s point man on immigration issues, has long been suspicious of economically successful immigrants.",pro-immigration
"What’s more, whether or not you see a strong case for switching to a more skills-oriented system, America’s current immigration laws already make it so that newly arrived immigrants are better-educated than the native-born population.",pro-immigration
"Last but by no means least, even “unskilled” immigrants serve to increase the supply of skilled labor through their work in the household sector.",pro-immigration
"Patricia Cortes and Jose Tessada find that cities with larger numbers of less skilled immigrants see higher labor force participation and more hours worked by highly skilled women, who hire more hours per week of maids, nannies, and cooks, allowing them to shift their labor efforts out of unpaid home production and into market work.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants who do work mowing lawns, cleaning pools, and other household activities likely have a similar impact.",pro-immigration
"Immigration’s enormous benefits to immigrants is relevant It bears mentioning, even in an “America first” mood, that immigration carries extremely large benefits for immigrants themselves.",pro-immigration
"Indian computer programmers who come to the United States on H-1B guest worker visas, for example, see their earnings increase by a factor of five or six.",pro-immigration
"That’s an extraordinarily large benefit, and yet in the broader picture of immigration economics it’s a relatively small one.",pro-immigration
"Computer programming work, after all, can in principle be done remotely.",pro-immigration
Clemens finds that less skilled workers can obtain wage gains of tenfold or more by moving from poor countries to rich ones.,pro-immigration
These enormous benefits matter in part because foreigners are still human beings whose lives and interests ought to count for something in our calculus.,pro-immigration
"In other words, to the extent that there is reason to believe restricting the ability of some class of immigrants to enter the United States will have some benefits to some set of native-born workers, it’s worth considering that keeping a potential worker out of the United States is an extraordinarily costly measure to take.",pro-immigration
"Something much milder, like making employers of foreign-born workers pay an extra payroll tax, with the money used to plug the Social Security funding gap or subsidize low-paid workers’ wages, would leave absolutely everyone better off.",pro-immigration
The benefits to immigrants are also relevant because the economy is not a fixed pie.,pro-immigration
"If an Indian-born computer programmer moves to the United States and quintuples his income, he is much more likely to buy an American-made car than if he were stuck in Asia earning a dramatically lower income.",pro-immigration
"Growing exports of American manufactured goods has become an obsession, but increasing domestic sales has the exact same benefits.",pro-immigration
"Bringing the customers to our shores makes them easier to reach, and massively increasing their incomes massively increases their ability to buy things.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants are integral to American greatness Last but by no means least, while it’s certainly true that Americans care about the average well-being of American citizens, we also care about something else — greatness, for lack of a better word.",pro-immigration
"In per capita income terms, the United States has, by most measures, been overtaken by Switzerland.",pro-immigration
"The Netherlands is relatively close behind, and when you consider inequality and quality of public services, the typical Dutch person may well enjoy a higher standard of living than the typical American.",pro-immigration
This kind of thing matters.,pro-immigration
"But at the same time, there is a reason that when Americans feel anxiety about national decline, they tend to think of China and not Switzerland.",pro-immigration
"The Netherlands is a great place to live, but it hasn’t been a great nation since the early 17th century.",pro-immigration
"Aggregates matter, in other words.",pro-immigration
"If Americans had listened to the counsel of the Know-Nothing movement in the 1850s and drastically curtailed immigration from outside of Protestant Europe, it would probably still be a rich country today.",pro-immigration
"But it would be a very different kind of rich country from the one we know — one with fewer, smaller cities mainly focused on exporting agricultural goods and other natural resources to the wider world.",pro-immigration
"A place more like Canada or a supersize version of New Zealand, rather than an industrial and technological powerhouse that intervened decisively in two world wars and anchored a coalition of liberal states to defeat communism.",pro-immigration
"Going forward, demographers forecast that immigration — both the people it provides directly and the children that immigrants bear and raise — is the only reason America’s working-age population isn’t declining.",pro-immigration
This is doubly true when you consider that immigrants’ work in the household and child care sectors likely serves to increase native-born Americans’ childbearing as well.,pro-immigration
"A declining working-age population, seen already in Japan and some southern European countries, poses some serious challenges to a national economy.",pro-immigration
"It tends to push interest rates down to an incredibly low level, making it difficult for central banks to respond to a recession.",pro-immigration
It also makes it more difficult to sustain public sector retirement programs and elder care more generally.,pro-immigration
"There are some offsetting upsides (less strain on transportation infrastructure, for example), and, like anything else, the problems are solvable.",pro-immigration
"Fundamentally, however, an America that is shrinking is a country that is going to be a lesser force in the world than an America that is growing.",pro-immigration
"It’s true, of course, that an America that continues to be open to immigrants will be a progressively less white and less Christian country over time.",pro-immigration
"That’s a threatening prospect to many white Christian Americans, who implicitly identify the country in ethnic and sectarian terms.",pro-immigration
But America’s formal self-definition has never been in those terms.,pro-immigration
"And for those who believe in the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the value of America’s ideals, accepting a future of decline and retreat in the name of ethnic purity should be unacceptable.",pro-immigration
That the more homogeneous America will be not just smaller and weaker but also poorer on a per capita basis only underscores what folly it would be to embrace the narrow vision.,pro-immigration
That hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to move to our shores — and that America has a long tradition of assimilating foreigners and a political mythos and civil culture that is conducive to doing so — is an enormous source of national strength.,pro-immigration
It’s time we started to see it that way.,pro-immigration
WHY THE UNITED STATES NEEDS MORE IMMIGRANTS .,pro-immigration
"As controversy continued to rage on Thursday about the Trump Administration’s policy of separating migrant families at the southern border, the Census Bureau published new data that show why the United States will need more immigrants, not fewer, in the coming decades.",pro-immigration
"Demographers and economists have been warning that the aging baby-boomer population presents a serious challenge to the nation’s finances, as the ratio of seniors to working-age adults—the age-dependency ratio—rises.",pro-immigration
"The reason is straightforward: Social Security and Medicare are largely financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, which means that some of the taxes paid by current workers are transferred to current retirees.",pro-immigration
"If the dependency ratio rises, the financial burden on the working-age population also increases.",pro-immigration
A front-page piece in Thursday’s Wall Street Journal pointed out that this problem was contained for a long time because the age-dependency ratio remained relatively steady.,pro-immigration
"In 1980, there were nineteen Americans age sixty-five or older for every hundred Americans between the ages of eighteen and sixty-four.",pro-immigration
The dependency ratio was nineteen per cent.,pro-immigration
"By 2010, it crept up to twenty-one per cent, an increase of just two percentage points in thirty years.",pro-immigration
But the end of 2010 marked an important threshold.,pro-immigration
"In 2011, the first members of the baby-boom generation (people born between 1946 and 1964) turned sixty-five.",pro-immigration
"By 2017, the age-dependency ratio had risen to twenty-five per cent—an increase of four percentage points in just seven years.",pro-immigration
"In the coming decades, it is expected to rise even more sharply.",pro-immigration
"By 2030, “the ratio would climb to 35 retiree-age Americans for every 100 of working age .",pro-immigration
"and 42 by 2060,” the Journal story said, citing projections released earlier this year.",pro-immigration
These projections take into account the big rise in immigration that occurred between 1990 and 2010.,pro-immigration
"During those twenty years, according to Census Bureau data, the total number of foreign-born people (documented and undocumented) living in the United States roughly doubled, to about forty million.",pro-immigration
But this influx of working-age people—the vast majority of whom are immigrants of working age—wasn’t enough to offset a decrease in birth rates that began in the nineteen-seventies and has recently accelerated.,pro-immigration
"The easiest way to grasp the seriousness of what is happening is to look at the fertility rate, which is the average number of babies born to mothers between the ages of fifteen and forty-four.",pro-immigration
"Merely to replace the existing population, the fertility rate needs to be about 2.1 per cent.",pro-immigration
"During the baby-boomer years, it reached 3.7 per cent.",pro-immigration
"In 2017, it was just 1.76 per cent.",pro-immigration
"If this trend persists, as it seems likely to do, it portends a declining population and a sharply rising dependency ratio.",pro-immigration
"From a public-finance perspective, there are several possible ways to tackle the looming challenge.",pro-immigration
One is to reduce the level of retirement benefits significantly—but that would be very unpopular and difficult to achieve politically.,pro-immigration
"A second option is to increase the proportion of people who are working, among both working-age people and senior citizens.",pro-immigration
"That, too, would be a mighty challenge, because the trend is going in the opposite direction.",pro-immigration
"Since the start of 2000, the employment-to-population ratio among adults sixteen or older has fallen, from 64.6 per cent to 60.4 per cent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",pro-immigration
"To be sure, the Great Recession and its aftermath were partly responsible for this decline.",pro-immigration
But so was the aging population: employment rates tend to decline in older-age cohorts.,pro-immigration
"VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER Separated by a Smuggler  The final option is to welcome more immigrants, particularly younger immigrants, so that, in the coming decades, they and their descendants will find work and contribute to the tax base.",pro-immigration
Almost all economists agree that immigration raises G.D.P.,pro-immigration
and stimulates business development by increasing the supply of workers and entrepreneurs.,pro-immigration
There is some disagreement about the net fiscal impact of first-generation migrants.,pro-immigration
"The argument is that they tend to be less educated and therefore earn lower wages than the native population, and that they tend to contribute less in taxes.",pro-immigration
But this is disputed.,pro-immigration
"There is no doubt about the contribution that immigrant families make over the longer term, however.",pro-immigration
"“Second-generation adults—the children of immigrants—had, on average, a more favorable net fiscal impact for all government levels combined than either first-generation immigrants or the rest of the native-born population,” a study of the period from 1994–2013 by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, published in 2016, pointed out.",pro-immigration
"“Reflecting their slightly higher educational achievement, as well as their higher wages and salaries, the second generation contributed more in taxes on a per capita basis during working ages than did their parents or other native-born Americans.”  In the long run, welcoming immigrants is a good investment for the United States.",pro-immigration
The entire history of the country demonstrates this fact.,pro-immigration
But the current President wants to go in the opposite direction.,pro-immigration
"Along with introducing draconian measures to curb the influx of undocumented migrants, he wants to slash legal immigration.",pro-immigration
"At the moment, the United States grants permanent-resident status to about a million people a year, and many of these folks go on to become U.S. citizens.",pro-immigration
"Trump wants to cut this number in half, roughly speaking.",pro-immigration
A Crisis at the Border  More coverage of the Trump Administration’s immigration policy from The New Yorker.,pro-immigration
"His policy isn’t driven by economics, of course.",pro-immigration
"As he more or less admitted earlier this year, with his derisive comments about immigrants from “shithole countries,” it is driven by racism and a desire to resist the emergence of a nonwhite majority in the United States—a transformation that is inevitable and necessary.",pro-immigration
What’s largely driving this transformation is the aging of the white population and a concomitant fall in white birth rates.,pro-immigration
"In twenty-six states, according to a recent study from the Applied Population Lab at the University of Wisconsin, deaths in the white population now outnumber births.",pro-immigration
"In other words, the number of white people in America is declining.",pro-immigration
The new Census Bureau figures suggest that this is also true on the national level.,pro-immigration
"In 2016 and 2017, the number of white, non-Hispanic Americans fell by forty-one thousand, according to the Journal report.",pro-immigration
"That number is partly an artifact of the opioid epidemic, but the underlying picture is clear: with the native white population aging rapidly, the U.S. economy and fiscal system are in dire need of other groups to pick up the slack.",pro-immigration
"Fortunately, there are eager candidates, including the roughly six million non-Americans who file immigration applications every year, and the thousands of parents and children currently languishing in detention centers operated by U.S. immigration authorities and the Department of Health and Human Services.",pro-immigration
This shortage of young people is far from just an American phenomenon.,pro-immigration
"(In many European countries, the age-dependency ratio is rising even faster.)",pro-immigration
This doesn’t justify a policy of open borders.,pro-immigration
"But it does mean that the United States needs a President who is willing to face the real challenges facing the country, and recognize the benefits of large-scale immigration.",pro-immigration
IMMIGRANTS AND THE ECONOMY .,pro-immigration
"BACKGROUND  Blaming immigrants for the nation's woes has long been an American pastime, especially in hard economic times like today.",pro-immigration
"Recently, there has been an upsurge in anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in areas of the country that host large number of immigrants.",pro-immigration
"Public opinion surveys indicate that the public does draw a distinction between legal and undocumented immigrants, and that the public regards undocumented immigrants with increasing disfavor.",pro-immigration
"One of the most well-entrenched myths about immigrants is that they steal jobs from American workers, collect an excess of government benefits and in general represent a drain on the economy.",pro-immigration
"According to an August 1993 Field Poll of Californians, 39 percent of respondents agreed that illegal immigrants are ""taking jobs away from Californians.""",pro-immigration
But these are all myths that must be refuted to create a more hospitable environment for immigrants' rights.,pro-immigration
"IN BRIEF   Contrary to popular belief, immigrants do not take away jobs from American workers.",pro-immigration
"Instead, they create new jobs by forming new businesses, spending their incomes on American goods and services, paying taxes and raising the productivity of U.S. businesses.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants are good for the economy, not the other way around.",pro-immigration
"A U.S. Department of Labor study prepared by the Bush Administration noted that the perception that immigrants take jobs away from American workers is ""the most persistent fallacy about immigration in popular thought"" because it is based on the mistaken assumption that there is only a fixed number of jobs in the economy.",pro-immigration
"Experts note that immigrants are blamed for unemployment because Americans can see the jobs immigrants fill but not the jobs they create through productivity, capital formation and demand for goods and services.",pro-immigration
Immigrants pay more than $90 billion in taxes every year and receive only $5 billion in welfare.,pro-immigration
"Without their contributions to the public treasury, the economy would suffer enormous losses.",pro-immigration
"ACLU POLICY  The ACLU recognizes that the U.S., like every country, has the right to control who enters the country and to enforce the integrity of its internationally recognized borders.",pro-immigration
It also has the right to deport persons in the country who are not authorized to be here.,pro-immigration
"However, the ACLU also believes that the power to exclude and deport must be exercised fairly, humanely and consistent with the constitutional norms of due process and non-discrimination, and believes that the government must comply with the legal and humanitarian principles of international law that bind the United States.",pro-immigration
"ARGUMENTS, FACTS, QUOTES  In a 1990 American Immigration Institute Survey of prominent economists, four out of five said that immigrants had a favorable impact on economic growth.",pro-immigration
None said that immigrants had an adverse impact on economic growth.,pro-immigration
A 1994 study of unemployment and immigration by Richard Vedder and Lowell Galloway of Ohio University spanning 100 years (from 1891 to 1991) found that higher rates of foreign-born population historically have corresponded to lower unemployment rates.,pro-immigration
"The study found that immigrants expand total output and the demand for labor, tend to be highly productive and promote capital formation through high savings rates.",pro-immigration
"According to a L.A. Times analysis summarizing the best available research, ""Immigrants contribute mightily to the economy, by paying billions in annual taxes, by filling low-wage jobs that keep domestic industry competitive, and by spurring investment and job-creation, revitalizing once-decaying communities.",pro-immigration

The 14 Most Common Arguments against Immigration and Why They’re Wrong  Arguments against immigration come across my desk every day but I rarely encounter a unique one.,pro-immigration
"In 2016, I wrote a blog responding to the most common arguments with links to different research.",pro-immigration
"Since then, academics and policy analysts have produced new research that should be included.",pro-immigration
"These are the main arguments against immigration, my quick responses to them, and links to some of the most relevant evidence:  1.",pro-immigration
"“Immigrants will take American jobs, lower our wages, and especially hurt the poor.”  This is the most common argument and also the one with the greatest amount of evidence rebutting it.",pro-immigration
"First, the displacement effect is small if it even affects natives at all.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants are typically attracted to growing regions and they increase the supply and demand sides of the economy once they are there, expanding employment opportunities.",pro-immigration
"Second, the debate over immigrant impacts on American wages is confined to the lower single digits—immigrants may increase the relative wages for some Americans by a tiny amount and decrease them by a larger amount for the few Americans who directly compete against them.",pro-immigration
Immigrants likely compete most directly against other immigrants so the effects on less-skilled native-born Americans might be very small or even positive.,pro-immigration
New research by Harvard professor George Borjas on the effect of the Mariel Boatlift—a giant shock to Miami’s labor market that increased the size of its population by 7 percent in 42 days—finds large negative wage effects concentrated on Americans with less than a high school degree.,pro-immigration
"To put the scale of that shock to Miami in context, it would be as if 22.4 million immigrants moved to America in a six-week period—which will not happen.",pro-immigration
Some doubt Borjas’s finding and Borjas’s response.,pro-immigration
"Even if the Mariel Boatlift had such a large and negative effect on the wages of native-born high-school dropouts in Miami, it had a large positive impact on the wages of natives with only a high school education, to such a degree that the wages of lower-skilled Miamians actually increased.",pro-immigration
The rapid recovery of Hispanic wages in Miami also produces some doubt as to Mariel’s effect on native wages as Hispanics were the most likely to suffer wage declines from competition with the new Cuban immigrants.,pro-immigration
Economists Michael Clemens and Jennifer Hunt have the most devastating response to Borjas: His response was due entirely to a different sample collected in Miami over the years where he observed the wage decline.,pro-immigration
"Thus, the data collectors made Mariel look like it had a large negative wage effect by changing whom they surveyed.",pro-immigration
"Although some doubt Borjas’s finding regarding Mariel, it is not in doubt that immigration has overall increased the wages and income of Americans.",pro-immigration
"The smallest estimated immigration surplus, as it is called, is equal to about 0.24 percent of GDP—which excludes the gains to immigrants and just focuses on those of native-born Americans.",pro-immigration
“Immigrants abuse the welfare state.”  Most legal immigrants do not have access to means-tested welfare for their first five years here with few exceptions that are mostly determined on the state level and funded with state taxes.,pro-immigration
Illegal immigrants don’t have access at all—except for emergency Medicaid.,pro-immigration
Immigrants are less likely to use means-tested welfare benefits than similar native-born Americans.,pro-immigration
"When they do use welfare, the dollar value of benefits consumed is smaller.",pro-immigration
"If poor native-born Americans used Medicaid at the same rate and consumed the same value of benefits as poor immigrants, the program would be 42 percent smaller.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants also make large net contributions to Medicare and Social Security, the largest portions of the welfare state, because of their ages, ineligibility, and their greater likelihood of retiring in other countries.",pro-immigration
"Far from draining the welfare state, immigrants have given the entitlement portions a few more years of operation before bankruptcy.",pro-immigration
"If you’re still worried about foreign-born consumption of welfare benefits, as I am, then it is far easier and cheaper to build a higher wall around the welfare state, instead of around the country.",pro-immigration
"“Immigrants increase the budget deficit and government debt.""",pro-immigration
Related to the welfare argument is the argument that immigrants consume more in government benefits than they generate in tax revenue.,pro-immigration
The empirics on this are fairly consistent— immigrants in the United States have about a net-zero impact on government budgets (the published version of that working paper is available here).,pro-immigration
"A new model published by the National Academies of Sciences in their massive literature survey of the economics of immigration finds that age is the most important factor in estimating whether a new immigrant will be a net fiscal drain or contributor to government coffers, followed by education.",pro-immigration
"In their best model (results in Table 8-14), immigrants who are high-school dropouts have a net-positive fiscal impact on government coffers if they arrive before age 25 while the most educated immigrants have a negative effect if they arrive after age 64.",pro-immigration
Their model also finds that Americans with a low level of education impose a larger fiscal burden than immigrants with the same education level.,pro-immigration
"It seems odd that poor immigrants don’t create a larger deficit, but there are many factors explaining that.",pro-immigration
The first is that higher immigrant fertility and the long-run productivity of those people born in the United States generates a lot of tax revenue.,pro-immigration
The second is that immigrants grow the economy considerably (this is different from the immigration surplus discussed above) and increase tax revenue.,pro-immigration
"The third is that many immigrants come when they are young but not young enough to be in public schools for as long as natives, thus they work and pay taxes before consuming hundreds of thousands of dollars in public schools costs and welfare benefits—meaning they give an immediate fiscal boost.",pro-immigration
There are many other reasons as well.,pro-immigration
"Although the tax incidence from immigrants is what matters for the fiscal consequences, between 50 percent and 75 percent of illegal immigrants comply with federal tax law.",pro-immigration
States that rely on consumption or property taxes tend to garner a surplus from taxes paid by unlawful immigrants while those that rely on income taxes do not.,pro-immigration
"“Immigrants increase economic inequality.”  In a post-Piketty world, the argument that immigration is increasing economic inequality within nations is getting some attention.",pro-immigration
"While most forms of economic inequality are increasing among people within nations, global inequality  is likely falling and at a historic low point due to rapid economic growth in much of the world over the last generation.",pro-immigration
The evidence on how immigration affects economic inequality in the United States is mixed—some research finds relatively small effects and others find substantial ones.,pro-immigration
The variance in findings can be explained by research methods—there is a big difference in outcomes between a study that measures how immigration affects economic inequality only among natives and another study that includes immigrants and their earnings.,pro-immigration
Both methods seem reasonable but the effects on inequality are small compared to other factors.,pro-immigration
A more recent finding is that immigrants increase wealth inequality by their effect on the price of real-estate in American cities.,pro-immigration
About a third of the real-estate price increase from 1970-2010 in American cities can be explained by the increase in immigration.,pro-immigration
"Frankly, I don’t see the problem if an immigrant quadruples his income by coming to the United States, barely affects the wages of native-born Americans here, and increases economic inequality as a result.",pro-immigration
The standard of living is much more important than the earnings distribution and everybody in this situation either wins or is unaffected.,pro-immigration
“Today’s immigrants don’t assimilate like immigrants from previous waves did.”  There is a large amount of research that indicates immigrants are assimilating as well as or better than previous immigrant groups—even Mexicans.,pro-immigration
The first piece of research is the National Academy of Science’s (NAS) September 2015 book titled The Integration of Immigrants into American Society.,pro-immigration
It’s a thorough and brilliant summation of the relevant academic literature on immigrant assimilation.,pro-immigration
"Bottom line:  Assimilation is never perfect and always takes time, but it’s going very well.",pro-immigration
The second book is a July 2015 book entitled Indicators of Immigrant Integration 2015 that analyzes immigrant and second-generation integration on 27 measurable indicators across the OECD and EU countries.,pro-immigration
"This report finds more problems with immigrant assimilation in Europe, especially for those from outside of the European Union, but the findings for the United States are quite positive.",pro-immigration
"The third work, by University of Washington economist Jacob Vigdor, compares modern immigrant civic and cultural assimilation to that of immigrants from the early 20th century (an earlier draft of his book chapter is here, the published version is available in this collection).",pro-immigration
"If you think early 20th century immigrants and their descendants eventually assimilated successfully, Vigdor’s conclusion is reassuring:  While there are reasons to think of contemporary migration from Spanish-speaking nations as distinct from earlier waves of immigration, evidence does not support the notion that this wave of migration poses a true threat to the institutions that withstood those earlier waves.",pro-immigration
"Basic indicators of assimilation, from naturalization to English ability, are if anything stronger now than they were a century ago.",pro-immigration
"Ethnic attrition, which is when immigrants and their descendants shed their identification with ethnic or country-of-origin identity, does complicate how social scientists measure immigrant assimilation.",pro-immigration
"Through intermarriage and time, the more educated descendants of Hispanic immigrants fail to identify as Hispanic which biases the view of assimilation over the generations for those who rely purely on ethnic self-identification.",pro-immigration
Adjusting for ethnic attrition by tracking the outcomes of the descendants of all Hispanic immigrants shows rapid and continual assimilation over the generations that is comparable to the immigrants from the Age of Migration that ended a century ago.,pro-immigration
"For the nostalgic among us who believe that immigrants assimilated more smoothly in the past, the plethora of ethnic and anti-Catholic riots, the nativist Know-Nothing movement, and immigrant groups that refused to assimilate are a useful tonic.",pro-immigration
"Immigrant assimilation is always messy and it looks bad when you’re in the thick of it, as we are right now, but the trends are positive and pointing in the right direction.",pro-immigration
"Even though the evidence of immigration assimilation should comfort skeptics, some have proposed massive new government programs to help boost immigrant assimilation.",pro-immigration
"However, evidence from the early 20th century Americanization Movement suggests that such efforts will fail or that they could even backfire and make new immigrants and their descendants less culturally and patriotically American.",pro-immigration
"There is evidence  that German Americans reacted most negatively to anti-German Americanization policies during World War I, to such an extent that they walled themselves and their children off from American society, which slowed the pace of assimilation.",pro-immigration
"Immigrant assimilation is too important to leave it in the hands of bureaucrats or other social planners who ignore the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” principle.",pro-immigration
“Immigrants are a major source of crime.”  This myth has been around for over a century.,pro-immigration
"It wasn’t true in 1896, 1909, 1931, 1994, or more recently.",pro-immigration
Immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated for violent and property crimes and cities with more immigrants and their descendants are more peaceful.,pro-immigration
"Some immigrants do commit violent and property crimes but, overall, they are less likely to do so.",pro-immigration
The most contentious debate concerns whether illegal immigrants are more likely to be criminals than natives or legal immigrants.,pro-immigration
A recent finding on this issue shows that illegal immigration is not correlated with violent crime rates nor is it causal.,pro-immigration
Data limitations on the federal government force researchers to estimate the incarcerated illegal immigrant population using the residual estimation method which finds that illegal immigrants are much less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans but more likely than legal immigrants.,pro-immigration
The state of Texas actually recorded arrests and convictions for specific crimes by the immigration status of the arrestee and convict.,pro-immigration
"In 2015 in Texas, there were 1,794 convictions against natives per 100,000 natives, 782 convictions of illegal immigrants for every 100,000 illegal immigrants, and only 262 convictions of legal immigrants per 100,000 of them.",pro-immigration
"For all but four crimes that accounted for 0.18 percent of all criminal convictions in Texas in 2015, there were fewer convictions against illegal immigrant than against natives.",pro-immigration
The year 2016 shows even lower criminal conviction rates for illegal immigrants relative to natives in Texas.,pro-immigration
“Immigrants pose a unique risk today because of terrorism.”  Terrorism is not a modern means to wage war.,pro-immigration
"There were a large number of bombings and terrorist attacks in the early 20th century, most of them committed by immigrants, socialists, and their fellow travelers.",pro-immigration
"Today, the deaths from terrorism committed by immigrants are greater than they were a century ago but the risk is still low compared to the benefits of immigration.",pro-immigration
"Overall, immigration is not correlated with terrorist attacks and the risk of being murdered in an attack committed by a foreign-born terrorsit is also small.",pro-immigration
"For instance, the annual chance of being murdered in a terrorist attacked committed by a foreigner from 1975 through the end of 2015 was about 1 in 3.6 million per year.",pro-immigration
"Almost 99 percent of the people murdered by foreign-born terrorists on U.S. soil were murdered on 9/11 and the attackers entered on tourist visas and one student visa, not immigrant visas.",pro-immigration
"The risk of foreign-born terrorism on U.S. soil has also increased fears over the government’s vetting system for new immigrants and travelers, prompting President Trump to temporarily ban travelers and immigrants from certain countries.",pro-immigration
"But according to my colleague David Bier, there have been very few vetting failures since 9/11.",pro-immigration
"From 2002 through 2016, only one radicalized terrorist entered the United States for every 29 million visa or status approvals.",pro-immigration
"Only one of the post-9/11 vetting failures resulted in an attack on U.S. soil, meaning that a single deadly terrorist entered as a result of a vetting failure for every 379 million visas or status approvals from 2002 through 2016.",pro-immigration
That is a very low risk especially compared to the pre-9/11 vetting system.,pro-immigration
“It’s easy to immigrate to America and we’re the most open country in the world.”  It is very difficult to immigrate to the United States.,pro-immigration
Ellis Island closed down a long time ago.,pro-immigration
"There isn’t a line for most immigrants in most cases and when there is, it can take decades or centuries.",pro-immigration
This chart shows the confusing and difficult path to a green card.,pro-immigration
Does that look easy to you?,pro-immigration
America allows greater numbers of immigrants than any other country.,pro-immigration
"However, the annual flow of immigrants as a percent of our population is below most other OECD countries because the United States has such a large population.",pro-immigration
The percentage of our population that is foreign-born is about 13.5 percent—below historical highs in the United States and less than half of what it is in New Zealand and Australia.,pro-immigration
America is great at assimilating immigrants but other countries are much more open to legal immigration.,pro-immigration
"“Amnesty or a failure to enforce our immigration laws will destroy the Rule of Law in the United States.”  For a law to be consistent with the principle of the Rule of Law, it must be applied equally, have roughly ex ante predictable outcomes based on the circumstances, and be consistent with our Anglo-Saxon traditions of personal autonomy and liberty.",pro-immigration
Our current immigration laws violate all of those principles.,pro-immigration
"The immigration laws are applied differently based on people’s country of birth via arbitrary quotas and other regulations, the outcomes are certainly not predictable, and they are hardly consistent with America’s traditional immigration policy and our conceptions of liberty.",pro-immigration
"For the Rule of Law to be present, good laws are required, not just strict adherence to government enforcement of bad laws.",pro-immigration
"An amnesty is an admission that our past laws have failed, they need reform, and that the net cost of enforcing them in the meantime exceeds the benefits.",pro-immigration
That is why there have been numerous immigration amnesties throughout American history.,pro-immigration
"Enforcing laws that are inherently capricious and that are contrary to our traditions is inconsistent with a stable Rule of Law, which is a necessary but not sufficient precondition for economic growth.",pro-immigration
Enforcing bad laws poorly is better than enforcing bad laws uniformly despite the uncertainty.,pro-immigration
"In immigration, poor enforcement of our destructive laws is preferable to strict enforcement but liberalization is the best option.",pro-immigration
"Admitting our laws failed, granting an amnesty for lawbreakers, and reforming the law would not doom the Rule of Law in the United States—it would strengthen it.",pro-immigration
"“National sovereignty.”  By not exercising control over borders through actively blocking immigrants, the users of this argument warn, the United States government will surrender a vital component of its national sovereignty.",pro-immigration
Rarely do users of this argument explain to whom the U.S. government would actually surrender sovereignty.,pro-immigration
"Even in the most extreme open immigration policy imaginable, total open borders, national sovereignty is not diminished assuming that our government’s institutions chose such a policy (I am not supporting totally open borders here, I am just using it as a foil to show that even in this extreme situation this argument fails).",pro-immigration
How can that be?,pro-immigration
The standard Weberian definition of a government is an institution that has a monopoly (or near monopoly) on the legitimate use of violence within a certain geographical area.,pro-immigration
It achieves this monopoly by keeping out other competing sovereigns.,pro-immigration
"Our government maintains its sovereignty by excluding the militaries of other nations, by stopping insurgents, and interrupting the plans of terrorists.",pro-immigration
"However, U.S. immigration laws are not primarily designed to keep out foreign armies, spies, or insurgents.",pro-immigration
The main effect of our immigration laws is to prevent willing foreign workers from selling their labor to voluntary American purchasers.,pro-immigration
Such economic controls do not aid in the maintenance of national sovereignty and relaxing or removing them would not infringe upon the government’s national sovereignty any more than a policy of unilateral free trade would.,pro-immigration
If the United States would return to its 1790-1875 immigration policy then foreign militaries crossing U.S. borders would be countered by the U.S. military.,pro-immigration
Allowing the free flow of non-violent and healthy foreign nationals does nothing to diminish the U.S. government’s legitimate monopoly on the use of force in the Weberian world.,pro-immigration
There is also a historical argument that free immigration and national sovereignty are not in conflict.,pro-immigration
From 1790-1875 the federal government placed almost no restrictions on immigration.,pro-immigration
"At the time, states imposed restrictions on the immigration of free blacks and likely indigents through outright bars, taxes, passenger regulations, and bonds.",pro-immigration
States did not enforce many of those restrictions and the Supreme Court struck down the rest of them in the 1840s.,pro-immigration
"However, that open immigration policy did not stop the United States from fighting three major wars: the War of 1812, the Mexican American War, and the Civil War.",pro-immigration
The U.S. government’s monopoly on the legitimate use of force during that time was certainly challenged from within and without but it maintained its national sovereignty even with near open borders.,pro-immigration
Those who claim the U.S. government would lose its national sovereignty under a regime of free immigration have yet to reconcile their opinion with America’s past.,pro-immigration
"To argue that open borders would destroy American sovereignty is to argue that the United States was not a sovereign country when George Washington, Andrew Jackson, or Abraham Lincoln were presidents.",pro-immigration
We do not have to choose between free immigration and U.S. national sovereignty.,pro-immigration
"Furthermore, national sovereign control over immigration means that the government can do whatever it wants with that power—including relinquishing it entirely.",pro-immigration
It would be odd to argue that sovereign national states have complete control over their border except they that cannot open them too much.,pro-immigration
"Of course they can, as that is the essence of sovereignty.",pro-immigration
"After all, I am arguing that the United States government should change its laws to allow for more legal immigration, not that the U.S. government should cede all of its power to a foreign sovereign.",pro-immigration
“Immigrants won’t vote for the Republican Party—look at what happened to California.”  This is an argument used by some Republicans and conservatives to oppose liberalized immigration.,pro-immigration
They point to my home state of California as an example of what happens when there are too many immigrants and their descendants: Democratic Party dominance.,pro-immigration
The evidence is clear that Hispanic and immigrant voters in California in the early to mid-1990s did turn the state blue but that was as a reaction to California’s GOP declaring political war on them.,pro-immigration
Those who claim that immigration-induced change in demographics is solely responsible for the shift in California’s politics have to explain the severe drop-off in support for the GOP at exactly the same time that the party was using anti-immigration propositions and arguments to win the 1994 election.,pro-immigration
They would further have to explain why Texas Hispanics are so much more Republican than those in California are.,pro-immigration
Nativism has never been the path toward national party success and frequently contributes to their downfall.,pro-immigration
"In other words, whether immigrants vote for Republicans is mostly up to how Republicans treat them.",pro-immigration
Republicans should look toward the inclusive and relatively pro-immigration policies and positions adopted by their fellow party members in Texas and their subsequent electoral success there rather than trying to replicate the foolish nativist politics pursued by the California Republican Party.,pro-immigration
"Although some Texas Republicans have changed their tone on immigration in recent years, they have focused primarily on border security rather than forcing every state employee to help enforce immigration law.",pro-immigration
My comment here assumes that locking people out of the United States because they might disproportionately vote for one of the two major parties is a legitimate use of government power—I do not believe that it is.,pro-immigration
"“Immigrants bring with them their bad cultures, ideas, or other factors that will undermine and destroy our economic and political institutions.",pro-immigration
The resultant weakening in economic growth means that immigrants will destroy more wealth than they will create over the long run.”  This is the most intelligent anti-immigration argument and the one most likely to be correct although the evidence does not support it.,pro-immigration
Economists Michael Clemens and Lant Pritchett lay out an enlightening model of how immigrants from poorer countries could theoretically weaken the growth potential of the countries that they immigrate to.,pro-immigration
Their model assumes that immigrants transmit anti-growth factors to the United States in the form of lower total factor productivity.,pro-immigration
"However, as the immigrants assimilate, these anti-growth factors weaken over time.",pro-immigration
"Congestion could counteract that assimilation process when there are too many immigrants with too many bad ideas, thus overwhelming assimilative forces.",pro-immigration
Clemens is rightly skeptical that this is occurring but his paper lays out the theoretical point where immigration restrictions would be efficient by balancing the benefits of economic expansion from immigration with the theoretical costs of degradation in economic growth.,pro-immigration
Empirical evidence does not point to this effect either.,pro-immigration
"In a recent academic paper, my coauthors and I compared economic freedom scores with immigrant populations across over 100 countries over 21 years.",pro-immigration
Some countries were majority immigrant while some had virtually none.,pro-immigration
"We found that the larger a country’s immigrant population was in 1990, the more economic freedom increased in the same country by 2011.",pro-immigration
Immigrant countries of origin did not affect the outcome.,pro-immigration
These results held for the United States nationally but not for state governments.,pro-immigration
"States with greater immigrant populations in 1990 had less economic freedom in 2011 than those with fewer immigrants, but the difference was small.",pro-immigration
The national increase in economic freedom more than outweighed the small decrease in economic freedom in states with more immigrants.,pro-immigration
"Additionally, large shocks into specific countries result in vast improvements in the economic freedom score.",pro-immigration
Large immigrant populations also do not increase the size of welfare programs or other public programs across American states and there is a lot of evidence that more immigrants in European countries actually decreases support for big government.,pro-immigration
"Although this anti-immigration argument could be true, it seems unlikely to be so for several reasons.",pro-immigration
"First, it is very hard to upend established political and economic institutions through immigration.",pro-immigration
Immigrants change to fit into the existing order rather than vice versa.,pro-immigration
Institutions are ontologically collective—my American conceptions of private property rights would not accompany me in any meaningful way if I went to Cuba and vice versa.,pro-immigration
Local institutions are incredibly robust under a model called the Doctrine of First Effective Settlement.,pro-immigration
It would take a rapid inundation of a local area by immigrants and a replacement of natives to upend institutions in most places.,pro-immigration
The second possibility is immigrant self-selection: Those who decide to come here mostly admire American institutions or have opinions on policies that are very similar to those of native-born Americans.,pro-immigration
"As a result, adding more immigrants who already broadly share the opinions of most Americans will not affect policy.",pro-immigration
This appears to be the case in the United States.,pro-immigration
The third explanation is that foreigners and Americans have very similar policy opinions.,pro-immigration
"This hypothesis is related to those above, but it indicates an area where Americans may be unexceptional compared to the rest of the world.",pro-immigration
"According to this theory, Americans are not more supportive of free markets than most other people, we are just lucky that we inherited excellent institutions from our ancestors.",pro-immigration
The fourth reason is that more open immigration makes native voters oppose welfare or expanded government because they believe immigrants will disproportionately consume the benefits (regardless of the fact that poor immigrants actually under-consume welfare compared to poor Americans).,pro-immigration
"In essence, voters hold back the expansion of those programs based on the belief that immigrants may take advantage of them.",pro-immigration
"As Paul Krugman aptly observed, “Absent those [immigration] restrictions, there would have been many claims, justified or not, about people flocking to America to take advantage of [New Deal] welfare programs.”  As the late labor historian (and immigration restrictionist) Vernon M. Briggs Jr. wrote, “This era [of immigration restrictions] witnessed the enactment of the most progressive worker and family legislation the nation has ever adopted.”  None of those programs would have been politically possible to create amidst mass immigration.",pro-immigration
"Government grows the fastest when immigration is the most restricted, and it slows dramatically when the borders are more open.",pro-immigration
"Even Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels thought that the prospects for working-class revolution in the United States were smaller here due to the varied immigrant origins of the workers who were divided by a high degree of ethnic, sectarian, and racial diversity.",pro-immigration
"That immigrant-led diversity may be why the United States never had a popular worker, labor, or socialist party.",pro-immigration
"The most plausible argument against liberalizing immigration is that immigrants will worsen our economic and political institutions, thus slowing economic growth and killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.",pro-immigration
"Fortunately, the academic and policy literature does not support this argument and there is some evidence that immigration could actually improve our institutions.",pro-immigration
Even the best argument against immigration is still unconvincing.,pro-immigration
"“The brain drain of smart immigrants to the United State impoverished other countries.”  The empirical evidence on this point is conclusive: The flow of skilled workers from low-productivity countries to high-productivity nations increases the incomes of people in the destination country, enriches the immigrants, and helps (or at least does not hurt) those left behind.",pro-immigration
"Furthermore, remittances that immigrants send home are often large enough to offset any loss in home country income through emigration.",pro-immigration
"In the long run, the potential to immigrate and the higher returns from education increase the incentive for workers in the developing world to acquire skills that they otherwise might not—increasing the quantity of human capital.",pro-immigration
"Instead of being called a brain drain, this phenomenon should be accurately called a skill flow.",pro-immigration
Economic development should be about increasing the incomes of people and not the amount of economic activity in specific geographical regions.,pro-immigration
Immigration and emigration do just that.,pro-immigration
"“Immigrants will increase crowding, harm the environment, and [insert misanthropic statement here].”  The late economist Julian Simon spent much of his career showing that people are an economic and environmental blessing, not a curse.",pro-immigration
"Despite his work, numerous anti-immigration organizations today were funded and founded to oppose immigration because it would increase the number of Americans who would then harm the environment.",pro-immigration
"Yes, seriously—just read about John Tanton who is the Johnny Appleseed of modern American nativism.",pro-immigration
"Concerns about overcrowding are focused on publicly provided goods or services—like schools, roads, and heavily zoned urban areas.",pro-immigration
Private businesses do not complain about crowding as they can boost their profits by expanding to meet demand or charging higher prices.,pro-immigration
If crowding was really an issue then privatizing government functions so they would then have an incentive to rapidly meet demand is a cheap and easy option.,pro-immigration
"Even if the government does not do that, and I do not expect them to in the near future, the problems of crowding are manageable because more immigrants also means a larger tax base.",pro-immigration
Reforming or removing local land-use laws that prevent development would also go a long way to alleviating any concerns about overcrowding.,pro-immigration
"Although we should think of these issues on the margin, would you rather be stuck with the problems of crowding that they have in Houston or the problem of not enough crowding like in Detroit?",pro-immigration
There are other arguments that people use in opposition to immigration.,pro-immigration
Many of those arguments revolve around issues of “fairness”—a word with a fuzzy meaning that differs dramatically among people and cultures.,pro-immigration
"Arguments about fairness depend entirely upon feelings and, usually, a misunderstanding of the facts that is usually corrected by reference to my 8th point above.",pro-immigration
These are the main arguments against immigration that I encounter and my quick responses.,pro-immigration
Opinion: Why immigration is really what makes America great — again and again .,pro-immigration
"My family roots here in America go back nearly 500 years, and like other patriotic Americans, I not only take great pride in this country, I also feel a great responsibility for making sure all of our children and grand-children can continue to experience America at its best.",pro-immigration
"I remember my early school days and how inspired I was the first time I read the Declaration of Independence and learned that our country was founded on the principle that “All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”    Today I am struck by how it seems we are beginning to stray from that fundamental belief that, for my family, defined patriotism and explained what makes America the greatest country on earth.",pro-immigration
It is crucial for all of us to beware of anti-immigration rhetoric that flies in the face of those Declaration of Independence words.,pro-immigration
"Consider the facts and economic reality that make those positions not just unpatriotic, but actually anti-American.",pro-immigration
The low birthrate of non-Latino Americans is not keeping up with the death rate of baby boomer Americans.,pro-immigration
"As a result, the growth of the U.S. labor force is in steady decline.",pro-immigration
"And without a growing labor force, jobs can’t be filled and the U.S. economy can’t grow.",pro-immigration
"Fortunately, America is the only major country in the world with a Latino cohort that is growing and adding 1 million working age individuals to our economy this year, and every year, for the next two- to three decades.",pro-immigration
"The only way the U.S. workforce and economy can grow is by adding more workers, and that means stimulating immigration.",pro-immigration
"In fact, more than 80% of the growth in the U.S. workforce has been because of U.S. Latinos.",pro-immigration
"Imagine what shape this country would be in without them, especially given the fact that even with them we have more than 7 million unfilled jobs.",pro-immigration
"The reality is that the only way the U.S. workforce and economy can grow is by adding more workers, and that means stimulating immigration.",pro-immigration
"Now, in the midst of that challenge, there’s a powerful effort to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the U.S. immigration policy known as DACA, which would result in a loss of 685,000 workers from the nation’s economy over the next two years, at a rate of more than 30,000 jobs a month, and siphon $460.3 billion from U.S. GDP over the next decade.",pro-immigration
"U.S. annual GDP growth is already down to a dismal 1.8% from its historical average of 3.2%, and falling.",pro-immigration
"Making that decline even worse by pulling the plug on DACA is anti-America, as it puts us in an even worse economic position and threatens our global standing.",pro-immigration
"If you’re an employer who is affected by the loss of 685,000 workers in an economy that already has more job vacancies than unemployed workers, good luck trying to keep your business thriving.",pro-immigration
It is expected that the cost of ending DACA to employers in turnover costs alone will exceed $3.4 billion.,pro-immigration
"The industries most affected by a loss of DACA workers include restaurants, construction, hospitals, retail, and other critical labor roles in technology, education, and design.",pro-immigration
"If you’re an American citizen depending on Social Security and Medicare, think about this.",pro-immigration
We’re two years away from experiencing the first year that Social Security expenses exceed income.,pro-immigration
"Our only hope for balancing the books, especially with 345,000 baby boomers leaving the tax-paying workforce every month, is to add new workers from wherever we can attract them.",pro-immigration
Ending DACA and cutting off $90 billion of tax revenue these workers generate for the federal government alone is a move that can only be construed as anti-senior American.,pro-immigration
"Read: Trump’s immigration policies threaten your Social Security  For those who have bought into the notion that DACA people are a danger to our society, the only thing you have to fear is fear itself.",pro-immigration
Here’s one fact you need to be aware of: only two-tenths of one percent of DACA enrollees have been removed from the program after committing crimes or being identified as gang members.,pro-immigration
That’s also an important part of the entire immigration picture.,pro-immigration
"The incarceration rate for native-born Americans is 1.53%, compared to 0.85% for undocumented immigrants, and just 0.47% for legal immigrants.",pro-immigration
"I marvel at the insight of Alexander Hamilton back in 1787 who said, “There can be no truer principle than this — that every individual of the community at large has an equal right to the protection of government.”   What we face today is more than a question of government protection; it is without doubt an economic question.",pro-immigration
"We are all accountable for not only sustaining America’s economic leadership in our lifetimes, but also for the lifetimes of the generations to follow us.",pro-immigration
"They deserve to inherit an economy that is robust in creating jobs, new companies, and new opportunities.",pro-immigration
Anything we do today to harm the U.S. economy triggers long-term negative consequences for them.,pro-immigration
"We owe it to ourselves, and to future generations, to keep the DACA portion of our economy intact, and to fix our immigration processes so we can grow our workforce and sustain an economically strong future.",pro-immigration
"As a patriotic American, I can’t help but remember the words of Abraham Lincoln who said, “Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves.”   While America contemplates the future of DACA and immigration, I hope we all remember what George Washington said about the American dream: ""I had always hoped that this land might become a safe and agreeable asylum to the virtuous and persecuted part of mankind, to whatever nation they might belong.""",pro-immigration
Are immigrants really taking away opportunities from other Americans?,pro-immigration
The question of whether or not greater restrictions should be placed on legal immigrants entering the USA has been a topic of heated debate for a long time.,pro-immigration
That debate came to a head with Donald Trump’s 90-day travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries.,pro-immigration
"While Donald Trump’s immigration ban was implemented with the intention of increasing anti-terrorist security measures, it plays into the overarching debate of whether or not legal immigrants are a detriment to the American economy, job market, and general wellbeing.",pro-immigration
"A commonly touted argument is that legal immigrants take job, health and educational opportunities away from American-born citizens.",pro-immigration
But data collected in those areas has actually shown the opposite.,pro-immigration
"In fact, in many cases, data overwhelmingly supports why legal immigration is good for creating more jobs, medical resources, and academic achievements.",pro-immigration
"For example, the Association of American Medical Colleges has warned that a ban on immigrants will only increase the shortage of doctors in America.",pro-immigration
And many tech and science professionals have shared their concern that a crackdown on immigrants workers will spark a brain drain in America.,pro-immigration

13 Of the Most Pressing Questions About Refugees Answered With Charts    3.,pro-immigration
"About 33,000 permanent jobs have been created by founders not born in the USA Companies founded by immigrants have not just added money to the economy, they also have created a ton of jobs.",pro-immigration
"Around 33,000 permanent new jobs have been created just by 40 of these billion-dollar companies.",pro-immigration
"This does not take into account all the jobs that have been created by serial entrepreneurs and investors like Elon Musk at Tesla, PayPal and SolarCity, or the 160,000+ temporary jobs that have been created by Garrett Camp at Uber, as well.",pro-immigration
"The argument that immigrant founders are job creators is backed up by a study from Funders Club, which found that of the 39 founders studied, there were almost 7,000 jobs created between them.",pro-immigration
That boils down to around 159 new American jobs created per one founder.,pro-immigration
"There are many new businesses built by immigrants While we are on the topic of new businesses, it’s important to highlight that this is not limited to successful startups.",pro-immigration
"New businesses and job growth powered by immigration can be seen throughout the market–in fact, there has been a 60% increase in income over the past decade for these immigrant-owned businesses in the USA.",pro-immigration
"Additionally, about 25% of all new businesses are opened by immigrants, which contributes directly to the US economy and creates even more jobs.",pro-immigration
Immigrants are also 200% more likely to start a new business compared to people born in the USA.,pro-immigration

We may include it in this article.,pro-immigration
Economic growth is not just unique to the business world It is not just highly skilled immigrant workers who create new jobs in America.,pro-immigration
Even manual labor jobs that are filled by immigrants help stimulate the economy.,pro-immigration
"And there is currently a shortage of manual workers in many states  For each farm job that is filled by an immigrant, there are three jobs created in related industries.",pro-immigration
"But because there are not enough American-born workers to fill these jobs, America needs immigrants more than ever, or they are going to leave billions of dollars and thousands of jobs on the table.",pro-immigration
Immigrants achieving advanced STEM degrees are driving job growth Immigrants that hold advanced degrees in STEM fields also contribute to job multiplication.,pro-immigration
"In fact, it only takes one new STEM job held by an immigrant with an advanced degree to create 2.72 new jobs in related fields.",pro-immigration
That means that any immigrant worker who has achieved a graduate level degree and is allowed to stay in the USA has the opportunity to become a job creator–and a taxpayer.,pro-immigration
"The types of jobs created by these highly skilled workers are usually high-paying, which brings more money back into the economy and, in turn, more paid in taxes.",pro-immigration

Immigrants complement native-born workers and raise general productivity through innovation and entrepreneurship.,pro-immigration
Immigrants continue to integrate successfully into American society.,pro-immigration
America is a nation of immigrants.,pro-immigration
That is not a cliché but a simple fact.,pro-immigration
"Almost all Americans today either immigrated themselves or descended from immigrants, whether from England and Germany in the colonial era, Ireland, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia in the 19th and early 20th centuries, or Latin America and Asia in more recent decades.",pro-immigration

Immigration is both a sign and a source of American dynamism.,pro-immigration

Facts about Immigration Immigrants come to the United States because of the freedom and opportunity it offers.,pro-immigration
They come to work and build a better life for themselves and their families.,pro-immigration
"Immigrants fill niches in the labor market, typically at the higher and lower ends of the skill spectrum, where the supply of native-born workers tends to fall short of demand by US employers.",pro-immigration

Five Myths and Realities of Immigration 1.,pro-immigration
Myth: America is being flooded with mass immigration.,pro-immigration
Reality: The rate of US immigration today is well below its historical average and below that of many other advanced nations.,pro-immigration
"According to the Census Bureau, the number of foreign-born residents of the United States was 43.7 million in 2016, or 13.5 percent of the total US population.",pro-immigration
"Although growing in recent decades, the immigrant share of the US population is still below its peak of nearly 15 percent in 1910.",pro-immigration
"In many other developed nations, such as Canada and Australia, the foreign-born are a much higher share of the population than in the United States.",pro-immigration
"More importantly, the rate of net migration to the United States today is far below what it has been in previous historical periods.",pro-immigration
"The United States accepts about 1.1 million permanent legal immigrants per year, which is a high number in nominal terms but is historically modest as a share of the US population.",pro-immigration
"The current annual US net migration rate (both legal and illegal, minus emigration), is 3.3 per 1,000 US residents.",pro-immigration
"That is less than half of the US migration rate in the peak years of the Great Atlantic Migration from 1880 to 1910 and below the historical US average since 1820 of 4.3 per 1,000.",pro-immigration
Myth: Immigrants depress wages and take jobs from Americans.,pro-immigration
Reality: There is no evidence that immigrants cause higher unemployment among Americans or depress average wages.,pro-immigration
Immigrants typically complement American workers rather than compete directly with them for jobs.,pro-immigration
"As immigrants supply labor, they also increase demand for housing and other goods and services, creating employment opportunities for native-born workers.",pro-immigration
"This is why, over time, there is no correlation between immigration and the general unemployment rate.",pro-immigration
"In fact, the number of jobs and the size of the workforce tend to grow together.",pro-immigration
"For those same reasons, empirical studies have found that immigration has only a small and generally positive impact on average wages.",pro-immigration
A study cited in the 2017 National Academy of Sciences report on the economic consequences of immigration found that the only native demographic group negatively impacted is adults without a high school diploma.,pro-immigration
"The wage impact on this group is small, in the range of 1 to 2 percent, and the size of this group has declined to less than 10 percent of the working-age population.",pro-immigration
"Evidence also shows that as immigrants move in, native-born Americans tend to stay in school longer and upgrade their education, raising their productivity and wages.",pro-immigration
"For more than 90 percent of American workers, immigration either raises wages or has no impact.",pro-immigration
Myth: Immigrants increase the danger of crime and terrorism.,pro-immigration
Reality: Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or to be incarcerated than native-born Americans.,pro-immigration
The risks from immigrant terrorism are relatively low compared to other dangers.,pro-immigration
Immigrants are less prone to crime for a number of reasons.,pro-immigration
"After surveying the available evidence, a major 2015 study on immigrant integration by the National Academy of Sciences concluded, “Far from immigration increasing crime rates, studies demonstrate that immigrants and immigration are associated inversely with crime.",pro-immigration
"Immigrants are less likely than the native born to commit crimes, and neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have much lower rates of crime and violence than comparable nonimmigrant neighborhoods.” Foreign-born terrorists have committed deadly attacks on US soil, most tragically on September 11, 2001.",pro-immigration
But the terrorists responsible for the deaths that day were temporary visitors in the United States on nonimmigrant tourist and student visas.,pro-immigration
Terrorist acts by permanent immigrants are much less of a theat.,pro-immigration
"According to research by Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, from 1975 to 2017, “.",pro-immigration
"the chance of being murdered in a terrorist attack committed by a chain immigrant or a diversity visa recipient was about 1 in 723 million per year,” a risk far lower than death by domestic homicide.",pro-immigration
Myth: Immigrants impose a fiscal burden on US taxpayers.,pro-immigration
Reality: Most immigrants pay more in taxes over their lifetimes than they consume in government benefits.,pro-immigration
Immigrants on average are net contributors to government.,pro-immigration
"Immigrants tend to produce more of a fiscal surplus, or less of a deficit, than similarly educated native-born Americans because they are eligible for fewer government benefit programs.",pro-immigration
"The children of immigrants are also more beneficial for government budgets than the children of native-born Americans because they tend to achieve higher levels of education, earnings, and tax paying.",pro-immigration
Higher-skilled immigrants are especially beneficial to government finances.,pro-immigration
"According to the 2017 National Academy of Sciences report, an immigrant arriving in the United States at age 25 with a four-year college degree will, over his or her lifetime, pay $514,000 more in taxes than government services consumed (at net present value).",pro-immigration
An immigrant with an advanced degree will pay a surplus of almost $1 million.,pro-immigration
"Immigrants without a high school diploma impose a lifetime cost on government of $109,000, but the cost is much smaller than that of a native-born adult without a high school diploma.",pro-immigration
Myth: Immigrants are no longer assimilating into American culture.,pro-immigration
"Reality: As with immigrant waves before them, today’s immigrants and their children are learning English and assimilating into American society.",pro-immigration
Immigrants are acquiring proficiency in English at comparable rates to immigrants in the past.,pro-immigration
Second- and third-generation immigrants are overwhelmingly fluent in English.,pro-immigration
"As the 2015 National Academy of Sciences report concluded, “Today’s immigrants are learning English at the same rate or faster than earlier immigrant waves.” In other important ways, immigrants are adapting to and integrating into American society.",pro-immigration
The 2015 National Academy of Sciences report also found that immigrants are more optimistic than native-born Americans about achieving the American Dream.,pro-immigration
"Rates of intermarriage between native-born Americans and immigrants have been rising, including among ethnic and racial minorities.",pro-immigration
"The Dark, Racist History of Section 1325 of U.S. Immigration Law Former HUD secretary Julian Castro told former congressman Beto O'Rourke to do his ""homework"" on Section 1325.",pro-immigration
Here's what he means.,pro-immigration
It was the first moment of fireworks Wednesday night.,pro-immigration
"Julian Castro, the former HUD secretary under President Obama, took a shot at his fellow Texan, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke on his record on immigration: “I think you should do your homework,” Castro said.",pro-immigration
"A little-known, near-century-old statute that’s the backbone of Trump’s family separation policy.",pro-immigration
Section 1325 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code makes it a crime for someone to enter the U.S. somewhere other than an official port of entry.,pro-immigration
"It’s what makes crossing the border without authorization illegal — specifically, a misdemeanor; re-entering after being deported is a felony — and it dates back to a low point in U.S. immigration history.",pro-immigration
Castro wants to repeal it.,pro-immigration
"“The reason they’re separating these children from their families is that they’re using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border, to incarcerate the parents and then separate them,” Castro said, referring to the 1924 Immigration and Nationality Act.",pro-immigration
"“Some of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it.",pro-immigration
"Some, like Congressman O’Rourke, have not, and I want to challenge all the candidates to do that.”   Congress passed a law implementing a quota system for European immigrants at the behest of immigration restrictionists and eugenicists in 1924.",pro-immigration
The law all but ended immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe.,pro-immigration
"Earlier laws had banned Asian immigration, but there was still Latin America to worry about.",pro-immigration
"In 1929, Coleman Blease, a white supremacist South Carolina senator who openly supported lynching, came up with a solution: criminalizing unauthorized entry.",pro-immigration
"By the end of the next decade, the U.S. had prosecuted more than 44,000 illegal entry cases, according to historian and UCLA professor Kelly Lytle Hernández.",pro-immigration
"As Vox notes, illegal entry prosecutions slowed down after that, and the law was barely enforced for most of the twentieth century.",pro-immigration
Enforcing the law was more trouble than it was worth.,pro-immigration
"But President George W. Bush, who oversaw the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, brought these prosecutions back in full force.",pro-immigration
Immigration offenses now make up the majority of criminal prosecutions.,pro-immigration
"Last summer, the Trump administration ramped up “illegal entry” prosecutions under the so-called Zero Tolerance policy that led to the separations of thousands of migrant families at the border.",pro-immigration
"Family separation was largely thought of as a Trump policy, and in some ways it was — the government can choose whether or not to prosecute people for crossing the border.",pro-immigration
There was never an on-the-books policy mandating the separation of migrant families.,pro-immigration
"Instead, the Department of Justice began prosecuting everyone who crossed the border without authorization.",pro-immigration
"As a result, parents were taken into criminal custody; their children, meanwhile, were sent to shelters for “unaccompanied” migrant children.",pro-immigration
"Put simply, the separations were a feature, not a bug, of the administration’s decision to enforce Section 1325.",pro-immigration
Any president could choose not to enforce Section 1325.,pro-immigration
Castro’s plan goes a step further: he wants to eliminate the statute that makes these prosecutions possible in the first place.,pro-immigration
"That doesn’t mean people could come into the U.S. without being deported — deportations would still be handled by civil courts as they always have been, but migrants wouldn’t be imprisoned and prosecuted before those deportations happened.",pro-immigration
"Castro called on his opponents to pledge to repeal Section 1325, and three others — Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, and Washington Governor Jay Inslee — said they would.",pro-immigration
"O’Rourke, meanwhile, said repealing the statute could incentivize human trafficking.",pro-immigration
"Earlier in the debate, O’Rourke said his immigration policy would ensure that people like Óscar and Valeria Martínez, the father and child who drowned while trying to cross the Rio Grande this week, would be allowed to enter the U.S.",pro-immigration
"But Óscar and his daughter weren’t asylum seekers, at least not in the legal sense.",pro-immigration
"His mother told the New York Times that Óscar and his wife had fled Altavista, a small town in El Salvador that is all but controlled by gangs, because they couldn’t survive on just $10 a day.",pro-immigration
"Tens of thousands of migrants like Óscar and Valeria are coming to the U.S. every day, and although they’re fleeing horrible conditions like poverty and violence, they wouldn’t necessarily qualify for asylum — asylum-seekers have to prove that they face persecution due to their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or their membership in a particular “social group.”  O’Rourke didn’t seem to understand the distinction.",pro-immigration
"“As a member of Congress, I helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don’t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country,” O’Rourke said.",pro-immigration
Then Castro interrupted: “I’m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum.,pro-immigration
I’m talking about everybody else.”,pro-immigration
"What You Need To Know About The Immigration Law That Criminalizes Unauthorized Border Crossings  During the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 race, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julián Castro challenged all candidates to join his call for the repeal of a controversial immigration law.",pro-immigration
"The law, Section 1325 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, makes entering the United States “at any time or place other than as designated by immigration officers” a federal crime.",pro-immigration
It’s among the most prosecuted federal crimes in the United States.,pro-immigration
Thousands of defendants are charged with violating Section 1325 each month.,pro-immigration
"The government shouldn’t “criminalize desperation,” Castro argued.",pro-immigration
"Instead, he advocated, it should treat the unlawful entry of undocumented migrants as “a civil violation.” That is, migrants who enter the United States without permission should be deported, not incarcerated.",pro-immigration
"Castro acknowledged that several other candidates on the stage in Miami, including Sen. Cory Booker, Washington Gov.",pro-immigration
"Jay Inslee, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, already agree with him.",pro-immigration
"But others, like former congressman Beto O’Rourke, don’t support Section 1325’s repeal.",pro-immigration
"“I don’t think it’s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country,” O'Rourke said.",pro-immigration
"During the second night of the debates, which featured a slate of another 10 Democratic hopefuls, most of the candidates on stage indicated their support for the measure’s repeal.",pro-immigration
The Backstory The United States placed few legal restrictions on crossing borders prior to the 1920s.,pro-immigration
"Even then, entering the U.S. without authorization wasn’t a crime.",pro-immigration
Deportations could be effected through civil legal process.,pro-immigration
"With Section 1325, Congress made “improper entry by alien” a crime in 1929 – soon after imposing strict immigration quotas based on national origin.",pro-immigration
"According to University of California Los Angeles historian Kelly Lytle Hernandez, white supremacist South Carolina Sen. Coleman Livingston Blease was its architect.",pro-immigration
"Criminal enforcement, however, remained rare for decades – even when the deportation of Mexican Americans surged in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.",pro-immigration
"Prosecutions based on Section 1325 only started ramping up in the first decade of this century, during President George W. Bush’s administration.",pro-immigration
"Family Separation Due to the Justice Department’s current “zero tolerance” policy, anyone who can be charged under Section 1325 should be charged with a misdemeanor.",pro-immigration
"That has, in thousands of cases, included parents traveling with children.",pro-immigration
"Once charged with this federal crime, parents must be taken into the custody of the U.S.",pro-immigration
Marshals – where children are not allowed.,pro-immigration
"Thousands rally at the Texas Capitol against the Trump administration's family separation policy in June 2018. CREDIT RENEE DOMINGUEZ FOR KUT The White House publicly disowned this policy in June 2018, just days before a U.S. District Court judge ordered the government to reunify all separated families.",pro-immigration
Yet this practice has continued at the border.,pro-immigration
"Based on my research about the federal prosecution of immigration crimes, I’m confident that repealing Section 1325 would not increase the number of undocumented people living in the United States.",pro-immigration
"Anyone without authorization to live in this country would continue to be subject to deportation, a remedy the Supreme Court has called “burdensome and severe.”",pro-immigration
The 5 Best Arguments Against Immigration—and Why They're Wrong .,pro-immigration
"No issue is more hotly contested today than immigration, with restrictionists calling for the deportation of illegals and a 50 percent cut in legal immigration.",pro-immigration
Here are the five strongest arguments against immigrants and immigration—and why they're wrong.,pro-immigration
They take our jobs and lower wages.,pro-immigration
"President Donald Trump has said that illegals, who are mostly low-skilled, ""compete directly against vulnerable American workers"" and that reducing legal immigration would ""boost wages and ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first.""",pro-immigration
"But as the president himself likes to point out, unemployment across virtually all categories of workers is at or near historic lows, so displacing native-born workers isn't much of an issue.",pro-immigration
"Virtually all economists, regardless of ideology, agree that immigrants, both legal and illegal, have little to no effect on overall wages.",pro-immigration
The most-vulnerable workers in America are high-school dropouts and economists say that low-skill immigrants from Mexico reduce that group's wages by less than 5 percent—or that they increase drop out wages by almost 1 percent.,pro-immigration
But it's also true low-skilled immigrants make things cheaper for all Americans by doing jobs such as picking fruit or cleanup on construction sites.,pro-immigration
"And consider this: In the developed world, ""There is no correlation between unemployment and immigration rates.""",pro-immigration
Immigrants go to hot economies and they leave when the jobs dry up.,pro-immigration
"More important, immigrants grow the population, which stimulates economic growth, the only way over the long term to improve standards of living.",pro-immigration
They're using massive amounts of welfare.,pro-immigration
"Since the late 1990s, most legal immigrants and all illegals are barred from receiving means-tested welfare.",pro-immigration
"The only real taxpayer-funded services most immigrants use are emergency medical treatments that account for less than 2 percent of all health-care spending and K-12 education services for their children, who often times are U.S. citizens.",pro-immigration
"For those immigrants who do qualify for programs such as Medicaid, food stamps (SNAP), or supplemental Social Security income (SSI), they use all these programs at lower rates that native-born Americans or naturalized citizens.",pro-immigration
"It's also worth noting that immigrants come here to work, not collect WIC.",pro-immigration
"Legal immigrant men have a labor-force participation rate of about 80 percent, which is 10 points higher than that of natives.",pro-immigration
"Illegal immigrant men have a participation rate of 94 percent, precisely because they can't access welfare.",pro-immigration
They don't pay their fair share.,pro-immigration
"Whether legal or illegal, all immigrants pay sales taxes and property taxes (the latter are factored into the cost of rental units for people who don't own homes).",pro-immigration
And all legal immigrants pay all the payroll and income taxes that native-born Americans do.,pro-immigration
"Amazingly, most illegals also cough up income and payroll taxes too.",pro-immigration
That's because most of them use fake Social Security cards and other documents to get hired.,pro-immigration
Somewhere between 50 percent and two-thirds pay federal income and FICA taxes.,pro-immigration
"In 2010, for instance, administrators of Social Security said that ""unauthorized immigrants"" contributed $12 billion to Social Security trust funds that they will never be able to get back.",pro-immigration
"According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, about half of illegals paid state and local taxes worth over $10 billion.",pro-immigration
They broke the law to get here and they're bringing all their relatives.,pro-immigration
Critics of illegal immigration often say that unauthorized entrants refuse to stand in line and wait for their turn.,pro-immigration
That's true but misleading.,pro-immigration
"For many immigrants, especially low-skilled immigrants from countries such as Mexico, there is really no line.",pro-immigration
"In 2010, for instance, just 65,000 visas were given to Mexicans, with the overwhelming majority going to close family members such as spouses and minor children.",pro-immigration
"The wait list had 1.4 million people on it, effectively meaning there is no chance of ever getting in the country.",pro-immigration
"Similarly long wait lists exist for the Philippines, China, India, and other countries.",pro-immigration
"And for all the fear of what restrictionists call ""chain migration,"" legal immigration under the rubric of family reunification consists almost exclusively of U.S. citizens bringing their spouses and unmarried minor children to live here.",pro-immigration
"The only other people that can be brought over are parents, adult children, and siblings.",pro-immigration
"However, due to the backlogs for most countries, that typically takes between 15 and 25 years.",pro-immigration
"If you start trying to bring your sister over when she's 25, you'll be lucky to welcome her by the time she turns 40.",pro-immigration
They're not assimilating.,pro-immigration
"""The melting pot is broken,"" say anti-immigrant activists, who worry that more foreigners in our midst will destroy American culture because they aren't assimilating the way past waves of newcomers did.",pro-immigration
The evidence for such pessimism is weak at best.,pro-immigration
"About one-third of Mexican immigrants marry outside their ethnicity or race, the same percentage as in 1990.",pro-immigration
"Successive generations also see massive gains in household income and home-ownership rates, too.",pro-immigration
"And when it comes to learning English, all signs are that Hispanics are less likely to speak Spanish at home than in years past and have higher and higher levels of proficiency in English.",pro-immigration

"When seeking to pass whatever the anti-gun flavor of the month is when it comes to gun legislation, anti-gun advocates often claim to be seeking only “reasonable” solutions.",pro-guns
"They often claim that if just one more marginal restriction on our rights is enacted, then we will be “safer.”  Nowhere was this more evident than earlier this year when anti-gun advocates and members of Congress worked to pass two anti-gun bills through the House of Representatives.",pro-guns
"That fight involved what gun control supporters frequently claim is the most “reasonable” of all gun control laws, H.R.",pro-guns
"8, the so-called “universal” background check bill.",pro-guns
"However, as we pointed out at the time, there was nothing reasonable about a bill that would turn law-abiding gun owners into criminals for harmless conduct while doing nothing to stop the violent criminals who are actually responsible for the crimes often used to justify such laws.",pro-guns
"8 were to become law, it would make the simple act of handing a firearm to another person a federal crime.",pro-guns
"There are exceptions, but they are so narrowly written that common and well-intentioned firearms transfers would still be crimes under the bill.",pro-guns

"There’s nothing reasonable about turning the gun owners in any of these examples into criminals, but even worse, anti-gun researchers have already found that expanded background checks are ineffective.",pro-guns
"In 2018, researchers at U.C.",pro-guns
"Davis, who are subsidized by California taxpayers to study gun control, and at Michael Bloomberg’s own school at Johns Hopkins found that California’s expanded background check law didn’t reduce firearm homicides or suicides.",pro-guns
"That finding was consistent with a review of past studies on expanded background checks by the RAND Corporation that found that “evidence of the effect of private-seller background checks on firearm homicides is inconclusive.”  Faced with this evidence, the gun control lobby’s own witness testifying on H.R.",pro-guns
8 admitted that expanding background checks was not really the ultimate goal of those supporting the law.,pro-guns
"During testimony, Robyn Thomas, Executive Director of the Giffords Law Center, stated “H.R.",pro-guns
8 is absolutely the right first step .,pro-guns
I think once H.R.,pro-guns
8 is passed there is a number of steps that this Congress can take to adequately address and reduce gun violence in America.”  It didn’t take long to see what those other “steps” would be.,pro-guns
"Only one day after an anti-gun majority in the House of Representatives passed H.R.8, they took up and passed H.R.",pro-guns
"That bill would flip the American concept of “innocent until proven guilty” on its head, at least when it comes to law-abiding Americans exercising their Second Amendment right to acquire a firearm.",pro-guns
1112 would eliminate a provision in current law that gives an option to federally licensed gun dealers to proceed with a sale if the FBI does not respond to a National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) request within three days.,pro-guns
"Under current law, the onus is on the FBI to show that a person is legally prohibited from possessing a firearm before they deny a NICS check.",pro-guns
This bill would grant the FBI blanket authority to indefinitely delay lawful firearm transfers.,pro-guns
An indefinite delay on the purchase of a firearm by someone who is not actually prohibited from purchasing a firearm is not “reasonable.”  But anti-gun lawmakers in Congress have not stopped with just these “reasonable” proposals.,pro-guns
"In September, the House Judiciary Committee again moved gun legislation that proponents describe as “reasonable.” The Democrat-controlled committee took up H.R.",pro-guns
"1236, the federal version of extreme risk protection orders, or “red flag” laws.",pro-guns

"The problem with this concept, however, is similar to the problem with H.R.",pro-guns
"1112; flipping the “innocent until proven guilty” standard to “guilty until proven innocent.”  At the state level, these laws frequently allow the confiscation of firearms before the gun owner has ever had a chance to tell their side of the story.",pro-guns

"1236 was advanced, the House Judiciary Committee took up H.R.",pro-guns
"1186, which would ban magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",pro-guns
"As NRA members are well aware, the idea of setting arbitrarily-determined limits on ammunition capacity for firearms has been promoted for decades.",pro-guns
"Pro-gun members of the committee tried to point out that this kind of experiment in gun control was already tried with the federal magazine ban that was in effect from 1994-2004, and the government-mandated review of the law found no drop in violent crime attributable to the ban.",pro-guns
"Undeterred, the anti-gun members of the committee passed the bill.",pro-guns

"This time, the gun control extremists on the committee were after America’s most popular rifle, the AR-15.",pro-guns

What they are actually promoting is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts strategy.,pro-guns

"Whatever label you attach to their strategy, the fact is that the anti-gun movement is clearly looking to inundate law-abiding American gun owners with as many restrictions as they can.",pro-guns
"And, if they can pass what they have proposed thus far, they have already admitted the desire for even more.",pro-guns
The hearings in the House this year have even further confirmed this.,pro-guns
During the hearings on H.R.,pro-guns
"1236 and 1186, Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal (D) referred to a “tapestry of laws” her party will try to pass.",pro-guns

"Before I started researching gun deaths, gun-control policy used to frustrate me.",pro-guns
"I wished the National Rifle Association would stop blocking common-sense gun-control reforms such as banning assault weapons, restricting silencers, shrinking magazine sizes and all the other measures that could make guns less deadly.",pro-guns
"Then, my colleagues and I at FiveThirtyEight spent three months analyzing all 33000 lives ended by guns each year in the United States, and I wound up frustrated in a whole new way.",pro-guns
"We looked at what interventions might have saved those people, and the case for the policies I'd lobbied for crumbled when I examined the evidence.",pro-guns
"The best ideas left standing were narrowly tailored interventions to protect subtypes of potential victims, not broad attempts to limit the lethality of guns.",pro-guns
the strictly tightened gun laws in Britain and Australia and concluded that they didn't prove much about what America's policy should be.,pro-guns
Neither nation experienced drops in mass shootings or other gun related-crime that could be attributed to their buybacks and bans.,pro-guns
Mass shootings were too rare in Australia for their absence after the buyback program to be clear evidence of progress.,pro-guns
"And in both Australia and Britain, the gun restrictions had an ambiguous effect on other gun-related crimes or deaths.",pro-guns
"When I looked at the other oft-praised policies, I found out that no gunowner walks into the store to buy an ""assault weapon.""",pro-guns
"It's an invented classification that includes any semi-automatic that has , such as a bayonet mount, arocket-propelled grenade-launcher mount, a folding stock or a pistol grip.",pro-guns
"But guns are modular, and any hobbyist can easily add these features at home, just as if they were snapping together Legos.",pro-guns
"However, the next-largest set of gun deaths — 1 in 5 — were young men aged 15 to 34, killed in homicides.",pro-guns
"These men were most likely to die at the hands of other young men, often related to gang loyalties or other street violence.",pro-guns
"And the last notable group of similar deaths was the 1,700 women murdered per year, usually as the result of domestic violence.",pro-guns
"Far more people were killed in these ways than in mass-shooting incidents, but few of the popularly floated policies were tailored to serve them.",pro-guns
"By the time we published our project, I didn't believe in many of the interventions I'd heard politicians tout.",pro-guns
"I was still anti-gun, at least from the point of view of most gun owners, and I don't want a gun in my home, as I think the risk outweighs the benefits.",pro-guns
But I can't endorse policies whose only selling point is that gun owners hate them.,pro-guns
Policies that often seem as if they were denied by people who have encountered guns only as a figure in a briefing book or an image on the news.,pro-guns
"Instead, I found the most hope in more narrowly tailored interventions.",pro-guns
"Potential suicide victims, women menaced by their abusive partners and kids swept up in street vendettas are all in danger from guns, but they each require different protections.",pro-guns
"Older men, who make up the largest share of of gun suicides, need better access to people who could care for them and get them help.",pro-guns
"Women endangered by specific men need to be prioritized by police, who can enforce restraining orders prohibiting these men from buying and owning guns.",pro-guns
Younger men at risk of violence need to be identified before they take a life or lose theirs and to be connected to mentors who can help them de-escalate conflicts.,pro-guns
"Even the most data-driven practices such as New Orleans' plan to identify gang members for intervention based on previous arrests and weapons seizures, wind up more personal than most policies floated.",pro-guns
"The young men at risk can be identified by an algorithm, but they have to be disarmed one by one, personally — not en masse as though they were all interchangeable.",pro-guns
A reduction in gun deaths is most likely to come from finding smaller chances for victories and expanding those solutions as much as possible.,pro-guns
"We save lives by focusing on a range of tactics to protect the different kinds of potential victims and reforming potential killers, not from sweeping bans focused on the guns themselves.",pro-guns
Nowhere was this more evident than earlier this year when anti-gun advocates and members of Congress worked to pass two anti-gun bills through the House of Representatives.,pro-guns
"That fight involved what gun control supporters frequently claim is the most “reasonable” of all gun control laws, H.R.",pro-guns

▪  Create a national licensing and gun registry.,pro-guns
And this would stop a criminal from killing someone how?,pro-guns
▪  Put a ban on assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines.,pro-guns
Define assault weapon and high capacity.,pro-guns
"▪  Implement a mandatory gun buyback program for assault-style weapons, and a voluntary buyback for other firearms.",pro-guns
Buyback defined: the buying back of goods by the original seller.,pro-guns
What business is going to do this?,pro-guns
Who is going to pay said business to do this?,pro-guns
There are an estimated 7-10 million weapons in use today.,pro-guns
"Then there’s that pesky 14th Amendment: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.",pro-guns
▪  Set a limit of one firearm purchase a month per person.,pro-guns
"And again, this would stop a criminal from killing someone how?",pro-guns
▪  Establishment a “national director of gun violence prevention” to report directly to the White House.,pro-guns
I have no idea what this is!,pro-guns
▪  Raise the minimum age to buy guns from 18 to 21.,pro-guns
"Under the age premise, we should prohibit persons under 21 from driving vehicles.",pro-guns
"According to the Centers for Disease Control, the risk of motor vehicle crashes is higher among teens ages 16 to 19 than among any other age group.",pro-guns
"In fact, per mile driven, teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are nearly three times more likely than drivers 20 years and older to be in a fatal crash.",pro-guns
"In 2016, 2,433 teens in the United States ages 16 to 19 were killed, and 292,742 were treated in emergency departments for injuries suffered in motor vehicle crashes.",pro-guns
"▪  A new multiple-step gun licensing system, overseen by Washington, that would include in-person interviews and a 10-day wait before gun purchases are approved.",pro-guns
Licenses would need to be renewed annually.,pro-guns
"Since we all know how well Washington works, can you imagine implementing a “multiple-step gun licensing system” and interviewing 393 million gun owners every year?",pro-guns
▪  A Peace Corps-style program that would pay for young people to work on gun violence prevention for a year in communities and nonprofits around the country.,pro-guns
"An estimated 20,000 gun laws on the books haven’t prevented shootings.",pro-guns
"Until the anti-gun crowd acknowledges and accepts the fact that it’s an individual committing a crime and not an object, there will never be a consensus from the pro-gun and pro-Constitutional side.",pro-guns
Criminals will never comply.,pro-guns
Can you understand that?,pro-guns
Show me how any of the above will stop or prevent more shootings.,pro-guns
Free People Bear Arms Gun control isn’t about guns.,pro-guns
It’s about control.,pro-guns
The very foundation of this country — the freest the planet has ever seen — was based on who would have the power and liberty that firearms represent: We the People or “them” (the government forces).,pro-guns
Freedom matters.,pro-guns
"When the government decided back in Revolutionary times that it should be in power and control the guns, free people stood up and decided we would control arms and delegate power to officials — not the other way around.",pro-guns
"It was a unique concept, never before attempted — the grand experiment of self-governance — and America was born.",pro-guns
It makes sense that the freest nation on Earth has the freest gun laws and best access to arms anywhere.,pro-guns
Freedom from gun control is what led to the ongoing emancipation of every class of men and women and will continue to do so.,pro-guns
You can’t arm slaves and expect them to remain enslaved.,pro-guns
The Second Amendment has made more women equal than everything the feminist movement imagines.,pro-guns
"Affirmative action and diversity movements pale before the power to keep and bear arms, the very bedrock on which everything else rests.",pro-guns
The freedom to arm is the unseen superconducting magnet attracting people to our borders.,pro-guns
Take away or restrict guns and you take away or restrict personal freedom.,pro-guns
Power comes from the barrel of a gun; so-called “gun control” takes that power and puts it in someone’s hands other than your own.,pro-guns
That must never happen.,pro-guns
"There’s a Reason It’s Controversial — Gun Control Doesn’t Work If gun control only stopped criminals and made the world safe, there would be no controversy at all.",pro-guns
"But that’s not the case, is it?",pro-guns
It remains among the most controversial of political policies and there’s a reason: It doesn’t work as advertised.,pro-guns
"People who promote gun control either seek control over you while their side remains armed, are acting out their abnormal fears or are ignorant.",pro-guns
"Whichever way, gun control is terrible public policy and is steadfastly resisted by huge swaths of the fabric in a free society.",pro-guns
It doesn’t control guns and it doesn’t control criminals.,pro-guns
Most new gun-control proposals are met with outrage and opposition because they assault personal freedom under some guise.,pro-guns
"Frequently, the promoted purpose and actual effect are totally different.",pro-guns
"If those opposed to gun rights revealed their true purposes, few people would support them, so lies, deceit and misdirection are typically needed to gain support.",pro-guns
"For example, “All we want to do is register dangerous guns,” seems harmless enough.",pro-guns
"But when you look carefully, it’s really, “We need that list of everybody who peacefully owns guns so when we ban any, we know where they are.” That is so ominous that only the power-hungry or irrationally fearful would vote in favor and, as such, lies are required to disguise it.",pro-guns
It’s not conjecture; it’s fact.,pro-guns
"New York and California have both required lists prior to confiscations, and nations throughout history did the same before committing atrocities.",pro-guns
"If gun control worked, they’d stop asking for more.",pro-guns
"‘Gun Control’ Is a Euphemism for ‘Disarm the Public’ — The Real Purpose Is to Leave Only ‘Officials’ Armed When you examine each new gun-control proposal carefully, you find it typically goes directly to disarming the public with little — or no — attention paid to controlling criminals.",pro-guns
"This is the great ugly secret about gun-control schemes the “news” media, public schools and officials hide from you.",pro-guns
"They often don’t even realize they’re doing it, but truly evil people are well aware they’re attempting to coalesce power in one set of hands — theirs.",pro-guns
"So-called “gun-control proposals” either eliminate arms for, limit arms for or subarm the public.",pro-guns
"Politicians draft bills to outlaw a type of firearm, accessory or ammunition you already own; restrict access, possession or ownership to quality firearms and components; or require small, inadequate or poorly functioning (subarmament) versions for you.",pro-guns
These are always falsely described as ways to stop crime or increase safety.,pro-guns
"Since convicted felons are already legally barred from having any type of guns at all, it’s obvious these new rules only disarm innocent people.",pro-guns
Criminals get any weapons they want the same way they get drugs — illegally.,pro-guns
The laws don’t control them — gun control controls you.,pro-guns
"(These inconvenient facts never get mentioned, as they would spoil the anti-gun narrative.)",pro-guns
Gun controllers twist words to distort the debate in their favor.,pro-guns
"“Gun violence” is a propaganda substitute for crime, murder, assault or jihad.",pro-guns
"A so-called “assault weapon” is a normal popular household firearm — “assault” is a type of criminal behavior, not a kind of hardware.",pro-guns

"But at first blush, it sounds cool and attracts support.",pro-guns
"Although universal gun registration is one of the gun-control community’s great holy grails, it has no crime-fighting effect.",pro-guns

"The list would need 80,000 changes a day to accommodate Americans who move once every 10 years.",pro-guns
It would be a nightmare — not to mention another bloated federal program.,pro-guns

Less crime is good.,pro-guns
What gun-rights deniers too often fail to recognize though is the lack of causal links between guns and crime.,pro-guns

"Sometimes these problems are created or heightened by government policies that liberal gun-controllers endorsed, but don’t worry, they’ll refuse to recognize (or admit) their role.",pro-guns

I first started examining the issue of “gun control” following the murders that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School.,pro-guns

"New laws were then passed in the middle of the night, with little or no debate, that were supposed to “solve” this problem.",pro-guns

"At that time, I came to the debate with no preconceived solutions, and no biases (that I was aware of) towards one side or the other.",pro-guns
"I owned no firearms, primarily because I wished to avoid the hassles associated with keeping personally owned firearms on military installations.",pro-guns
"At the time, I examined both sides on their evidence, and in light of the facts available to me.",pro-guns
"I listened to hearing testimony, read US Supreme Court opinions, examined the wording of proposed legislation and more.",pro-guns
"I even found several videos replaying particular scenarios, and examining how various laws might have affected them.",pro-guns
Here are just a small portion of the resources I found: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  The result of my own personal examination was that I could not find a single gun control proposal that would have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy.,pro-guns
Instead the proposals I read of would have only made the tragedy worse.,pro-guns
"Now that a new tragedy has reared its ugly head, the same old ineffective arguments are being rolled out to push the same ineffective solutions.",pro-guns
"It seems as though nothing has changed, save that nothing has been done to mitigate the carnage.",pro-guns
"To explain how I came to this conclusion, let’s start all the way back at the beginning, and then reason forward from first principles.",pro-guns
"I’ll keep the logic as simple as I can, so that you can see what I am arguing.",pro-guns
The Logic Made Simple Let’s lay out the logic carefully for what is happening in the US and around the world today with respect to mass murder.,pro-guns
"To do this, we’ll have to go all the way back to the beginning to get our logic properly oriented.",pro-guns
"Since Adam, all men have been trapped by sin.",pro-guns
(Rom 5:19) This has two meanings.,pro-guns
"First, it means that all men sin.",pro-guns
"(Rom 3:10, 3:23) Second, it means that men are condemned to sin, trapped by sin, and even forced to do so and punished when they do not (John 8:34, Rom 6:20).",pro-guns
Murder is one such sin (Ex 20:13).,pro-guns
The wickedness of man and the reality of murder are not unique to the USA.,pro-guns
"John Lott makes the strong argument, based upon comprehensive review of the statistics, that all it takes is arming a fraction of the citizenry to have a significant impact on crime.",pro-guns
He further argues that an unseen yet armed subset of the citizenry creates a deterrent effect upon crime–since a would-be criminal must then consider the possibility of encountering armed resistance.,pro-guns
"By this logic, it is the duty of every willing citizen to be both armed and prepared to keep this peace.",pro-guns
"Arming yourself is not immoral, but rather following the teachings of Christ himself.",pro-guns
(Luke 22:36)  Neither is the problem of murder specific to guns.,pro-guns
Abel himself will teach you that men committed murder long before they invented guns.,pro-guns
"(Gen 4:8)  If you get rid of guns, therefore, you will not get rid of murder.",pro-guns
(Rom 1:28-29)  Australia tried this.,pro-guns
It did not work.,pro-guns
"[1]  If you get rid of guns, you will not even get rid of mass murder.",pro-guns
"Examples of other mass murder weapons include Airplanes, Trucks, Fertilizer, Pressure Cookers, and more.",pro-guns
"By the law, the wicked are to be punished for their deeds, not the innocent (Ez 18:4-)  If the law is to have no effect on the innocent, then law enforcement must wait until a man commits a crime before he can be lawfully punished.",pro-guns
"Even background checks fails in this respect: before a killer commits his first murder, he is innocent under the law and no background check will stop him.",pro-guns
"For this reason, murders cannot be prevented, they can only be stopped after the murderer’s intention is revealed.",pro-guns
(Prov 24:11-12)  Mass murders have been stopped.,pro-guns
Mass murders that have been stopped rarely make more than a passing comment on the evening news.,pro-guns
"[1]  Ending a massacre quickly requires greater weapons in the hands of those that would create, keep and maintain the peace.",pro-guns
(Luke 11:21) It always has.,pro-guns
"A massacre can be ended early, but only when someone unexpected who is serving the public good is already present, armed and prepared.",pro-guns
"[1]  Most massacres end with the death of the shooter, either by his own hand or by the hand of another.",pro-guns
(Prov 28:17)  The typical “gun control” approach is to render firearms illegal in either all or particular situations.,pro-guns
"In the US, firearms are already illegal on most if not all school grounds.",pro-guns
"[1]  In spite of the good intentions of this law, it has not stopped would-be murderers.",pro-guns
Making firearms illegal doesn’t stop someone intent on murder from breaking the law.,pro-guns
It only makes it more difficult to limit the damage once his intent is revealed.,pro-guns
The US suffers from public massacres primarily in those locations where those who would serve the public good are disarmed.,pro-guns
I’ve seen figures suggesting that 98% of all mass murders take place where guns are already illegal.,pro-guns
"[1]  Such places of disarmament are politically referred to as “gun free zones.” In reality they are more appropriately termed “sitting duck zones,” since there are rarely any law abiding citizens present, police or otherwise, who can limit the carnage of a man intent upon breaking the law and committing murder.",pro-guns
"Depending upon the location, it may take 2-10 minutes before the police are on scene and perhaps longer before they are able to help.",pro-guns
"This leads to the saying, “When seconds matter, the police are only minutes away.” During those 2-10 minutes, the only individuals who can help to limit the carnage are those who are already present.",pro-guns
"Even if police are present, they have no duty to protect you.",pro-guns
"In other words, you are on your own for your own personal protection.",pro-guns
This also applies to those within a school once an individual begins a mass shooting spree.,pro-guns
"The problem is not limited to the very public mass shootings, and the logic above applies to individual self-protection as well.",pro-guns
"Sadly, there are many stories of honest citizens, intent upon keeping the law, who have been disarmed by the law, and so suffer at the hands of criminals as a result.",pro-guns
What law(s) can be passed to keep this from happening?,pro-guns
The first problem with this question is its flawed basis.,pro-guns
Underlying this question is the fallacious belief that good laws will make good people.,pro-guns
"As the logic goes, if only the right law were passed, we could somehow therefore make mass murder illegal and so it would no longer happen.",pro-guns
"The fallacy of this argument is laid bare when you consider that murder is already illegal, and yet murder still happens.",pro-guns
"Guns are already illegal on school grounds, and yet this well-intentioned law has not stopped school shootings.",pro-guns
"Biblically, the purpose of the law was never to make people good.",pro-guns
"Rather, the purpose of the law is to reveal sin–sin that would be present even without the law.",pro-guns
(Rom 2:13) .,pro-guns
"Therefore, the only reasonable implication that can be held is not that laws will somehow make people good, but rather that good people will pass good laws that can then be used to reveal the wickedness of mankind, and therefore judge the wicked.",pro-guns
"A law that turns an innocent man into a law-breaker does not judge the wicked, but is rather a corrupt law made.",pro-guns
"(Yes, this does mean that an innocent man may break a corrupt law and remain innocent.)",pro-guns
Humanity is corrupt The Holocaust was the result of a fascist government.,pro-guns
"They had guns too, just like all other governments today do as well.",pro-guns
But gun deaths happen far more often in the US than in other countries.,pro-guns
Maybe the US citizens owning around 310 mil.,pro-guns
guns plays some role in that?,pro-guns
If only the Holocaust was the only example of mass murder carried out by a government we might argue that humanity would no longer suffer from mass murder at the hands of a government.,pro-guns
"If only it was because of an unusual government structure, fascism, that we now know to avoid we might never see mass murder on this scale again.",pro-guns
"Sadly, the holocaust is only one government sanctioned massacre among many.",pro-guns
"I will cite here Stalin, Fidel Castro and the Killing Fields of Cambodia.",pro-guns
These are only modern examples of the wickedness of a mankind that has been corrupt for many millenia.,pro-guns
(Rom 3:10-15)  So?,pro-guns
How is this an argument for or against gun control?,pro-guns
"If anything, it is an argument for gun control because at the time of the Holocaust Germany had much loser gun control laws then now and back then there was a Holocaust and now there is not.",pro-guns
"But of course, that’s not a reasonable argument.",pro-guns
In fact I don’t think there is a reasonable argument to be made with regard to gun control legislation by citing Nazi Germany.,pro-guns
But you brought it up.,pro-guns
That’s why I’m asking you to explain to me your argument.,pro-guns
"What this statement misses is the fact that in order to commit their genocide of the Jews, the Nazi’s first needed to disarm them.",pro-guns
"Without this first “gun control step”, the holocaust would not have happened.",pro-guns
[1]  Maybe there is no problem.,pro-guns
Maybe that is just the “price of freedom.” (Like car accidents are often referred to as the “price for mobility”.),pro-guns
But it’s naive to think that there is no connection between lack of gun legislation and gun deaths.,pro-guns
"Your country, not mine.",pro-guns
You guys can set your priorities as you want.,pro-guns
But I think it would be wise not to ignore the obvious connection between gun legislation and gun deaths.,pro-guns
"Look at the data, then decide if it’s worth it.",pro-guns
But don’t be afraid to look at the data!,pro-guns
I mean foolish stuff like preventing the CDC from researching gun violence.,pro-guns
If you feel like you have to “protect yourself” from scientific data then you are probably trying to defend a weak position.,pro-guns
"Well, okay, since you would like to put forward the argument that fewer firearms will result in fewer homicides, let’s look at the data.",pro-guns
At the right is a chart showing the Gun Ownership and Homicide Rates for several countries who responded to a Small Arms survey.,pro-guns
"It’s shown as a scatter plot, to allow you to draw conclusions of any correlation involved.",pro-guns
"As you can see just by examining the chart, there’s several problems with drawing a conclusion from this data set.",pro-guns
"First, there are lots of outliers in this data rendering the conclusion not nearly as clear-cut as the quote above makes it out to be.",pro-guns
"Indeed, within this chart, the US is a very unusual outlier compared to the other nations within it.",pro-guns
"Second, were you to ignore the outliers and attempt to fit a linear regression anyway, you would still come to the conclusion that more firearms results in fewer homicides.",pro-guns
"So, go ahead, look at the data.",pro-guns
What correlation do you see within it?,pro-guns
(1)  And my point is that the availability of guns is making things worse.,pro-guns
We seldom hear of mass murder of children using hand grenades or rocket launchers (which I believe are illegal.),pro-guns
"Judging from the actual available data (shown above), I would draw the opposite conclusion: the availability of guns is not making things worse, but better.",pro-guns
"Why an assault weapons ban won’t help Following the US assault weapons ban, the CDC evaluated its effectiveness.",pro-guns
"From this, the “found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws reviewed for preventing violence.”  This should silence those critics who believe an assault weapons band would render this problem solved.",pro-guns
"While there are those who would argue the effect of this ban, in reality there was no clear evidence that it was either effective or ineffective.",pro-guns
"“Note that insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.” But putting that aside, if guns don’t play a role, that would then suggest that Americans are somehow more violent than other people.",pro-guns
Aren’t you guys human too?,pro-guns
[@BitlogIT]  There are those who would argue that the problem is that the weapons used by mass murderers were developed and intended for war.,pro-guns
"They should never, therefore, be in the hands of honest (or dishonest) citizens.",pro-guns
"If we could just keep these extra-deadly weapons from the hands of citizens, according to this argument, then we’d at least limit the number of murders a would be mass murderer can accomplish.",pro-guns
This logic is ill-posed for the simple fact that most weapons were designed for war.,pro-guns
"This includes not only the century old Colt .45, but also common pistols in use today such as the 1911.",pro-guns
"Likewise, it includes not only the M1 rifle used in WWII, but also the AR-15 which led to the development of the M16.",pro-guns
"As you can imagine, these firearms are drastically different in capability, yet they are all technically “weapons of war”–even though this argument is never applied to the full list but typically to the AR-15 alone.",pro-guns
It doesn’t help that there is no standard as to what constitutes an “assault weapon”.,pro-guns
This lack of definition makes the conversation more difficult.,pro-guns
"For example, many people believe that an “assault weapon” is one capable of automatic fire–i.e.",pro-guns
one that fires multiple bullets for each trigger pull.,pro-guns
"Such fully automatic weapons, however, have been so heavily regulated for years that they have not been used in any recent crimes–yet the politicians still call for their ban, confusing their constituents in the process regarding the underlying facts of matter.",pro-guns
"The result of this lack of definition is that most “assault weapon” bans limit the sale of weapons based upon their cosmetic features (flash suppressor, pistol grip, etc), rather than by their capacity to either harm or do good.",pro-guns
"Laws of this type are primarily political candy–they look good in the press, but in reality they are not very effective even in their stated goal.",pro-guns
"[1] [2]  As an example of the ineffectiveness of such a ban, the Columbine massacre in 1999 took place during the “1997 Federal assault weapons” ban with weapons that were not covered by the ban.",pro-guns
"The ban simply had no effect, but yet it made politicians feel good.",pro-guns
"Incidentally, there was “insufficient evidence” that the assault weapons ban had any impact in preventing violence.",pro-guns
"What it did do, however, was create a sudden demand for AR-15 type rifles.",pro-guns
"Indeed, today they are some of the most popular rifles within the US.",pro-guns
[1]  The other problem with this reason is that the tool of choice to end a massacre is an AR-15 type of rifle.,pro-guns
"As an example of this point, a recent church massacre was ended by a good citizen with an Ruger AR style rifle.",pro-guns
Won’t reducing the availability of guns solve the problem of murder?,pro-guns
"While this argument sounds good on its face, it fails in practice for the reasons listed above.",pro-guns
"If you make firearms illegal (and they already are on school grounds), then only murderers and criminals will have them.",pro-guns
"Murders then continue unimpeded until those allowed to have firearms, whether they be police or other, arrive to end the situation.",pro-guns
"As for drastically reducing gun availability, you can see how it affected the murder rate in Australia after they made rifles illegal: not much.",pro-guns
"[1]  In the end, this “solution” tends to only magnify the problem.",pro-guns
What if we made gun ownership illegal?,pro-guns
"While many politicians have discussed this possibility, in practice it cannot be done within the US.",pro-guns
"There are just too many firearms here, and it’s not likely that the entire population would turn them in.",pro-guns
"As one commentator pointed out, the next mass murderer is likely to already have the firearm(s) and ammunition he needs to create the next tragedy.",pro-guns
"If the current laws against murder will not stop him, making guns illegal won’t stop him therefore.",pro-guns
[1]  That’s from a practical standpoint.,pro-guns
"From a moral standpoint, the command against stealing applies to governments as well.",pro-guns
(Ex 20:15).,pro-guns
What about the “no-fly” list?,pro-guns
"This argument suggests that only terrorists are on the US “no-fly” list, and therefore if we prevented these individuals from getting firearms we would limit the problem.",pro-guns
"While this has also been proposed as a “common sense” solution, it also fails on its face.",pro-guns
"The “no-fly” list is a secret list, maintained by the government  Many innocent men and women (and children!)",pro-guns
"have found themselves on this list  The result is that this proposal would effectively punish the innocent, not the guilty.",pro-guns
"Because the list created and maintained in secrecy, there is no ability for the public to cross-check it with reality or to sue to have their name taken off of it.",pro-guns
"Indeed, the US constitution declares that,  … nor shall any person … be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; … (Ammendment #4)  As a result, the last time this proposal was discussed in congress, those proposing this solution left complaining that we would need to change our constitution to enact this “reform”.",pro-guns
Didn’t congress just recently remove the mental health exception from the background check law?,pro-guns
"Sadly, this argument is uninformed and stems instead from a lack of understanding US politics.",pro-guns
What actually happened started within the Veterans administration.,pro-guns
"If a veteran wanted his wife or family to handle the legal aspects of his benefits for him, he could file some paperwork to state that he wasn’t capable of handling his own benefits.",pro-guns
This had become a common practice and bore little reflection on the veteran’s mental capacity for good or evil.,pro-guns
This was a common practice for many years.,pro-guns
Then the Obama administration decided that these individuals were somehow more prone to murder than all other individuals–despite having no evidence to back up this claim.,pro-guns
They then declared these innocent men and women to be so incompetent that they should be prevented from owning firearms.,pro-guns
"This process was done contrary to the US constitution, which clearly states that  … no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.",pro-guns
Due process references an adversarial court hearing or trial where those accused of being mentally incompetent can present evidence to the contrary.,pro-guns
"This was not taking place, and hence it was an offense to the firearm-owning citizenry.",pro-guns
If it saves one child … This emotional appeal is fairly common.,pro-guns
It is used as a justification for knee-jerk reactions to children being killed by firearms.,pro-guns
"However, if you think this argument through, it can be applied in both directions.",pro-guns
"On the one hand, some argue that making firearms illegal might just save one child, and therefore the innocent should suffer (i.e., not be allowed access to particular firearms) so that this one child might live.",pro-guns
This is a hypocritical argument.,pro-guns
"By this logic, we should get rid of planes, trains, automobiles, hammers, and more, yet those making this argument are only willing to apply it to firearms.",pro-guns
"(Yes, it is true that more individuals are murdered with blunt objects than those that are murdered with rifles.",pro-guns
"[1]  On the other hand, if by getting rid of firearms we magnify the problems associated with school shootings because no one is available to provide a rapid armed response, then the argument could be applied in the opposite direction: if it saves just one child, then we should allow armed staff within our schools!",pro-guns
Why does Europe have fewer firearms deaths than the US?,pro-guns
This question cannot be answered on its face–there are just too many variables involved–something John Lott addressed in his book when comparing one part of the US to another.,pro-guns
"Were the murder rate uniform within both the US and (pick your favorite European country), then it might be possible that some one variable within the US was the cause for this difference.",pro-guns
"However, this is not the case.",pro-guns
"If you look at a map of murders rate by county, you’ll discover that some US counties have fewer murders per capita than some countries in Europe, while other counties have many more.",pro-guns
"Further, the researchers noted that the correlation is roughly inverse in firearms ownership–the more guns owned within a given county, the fewer murders per capita that take place there.",pro-guns
"[1]  Looking over the chart, it is noteworthy that California, Chicago, DC, New Jersey, and New York City have some of the highest murder rates.",pro-guns
These counties (and states) are also known for having the strictest gun laws.,pro-guns
"Hence, it cannot be the gun laws that solve the problem, but rather it may instead be that the gun laws are magnifying the problem.",pro-guns
"Indeed, the article cited above suggests the inverse correlation from the data: areas with more guns have less crime.",pro-guns
"Further, even the supposed correlation between US gun ownership and its crime rate doesn’t hold across Europe.",pro-guns
"In other words, not only is the US diverse in its population, but Europe is as well.",pro-guns
"[1]  “In 2012, Germany’s murder rate stood at 0.8, compared to 4.7 in the United States.” How do you explain this?",pro-guns
"I’m genuinely curious, this isn’t a rhetorical question to try to prove a point.",pro-guns
"I think the problem is that you look at the data locally: you start from a high gun availability/ownership, lower it a bit and crime rate/intensity rises > (normal, too difficult for “good” ppl to get a gun for self-defense, not difficult enough that “bad” ppl can still access.",pro-guns
"Unfortunately, you stop there in the logic and don’t see that by drastically reducing gun availability and making it truly hard to EVERYONE to get a gun you actually massively reduce the crime rate and their intensity (e.g.",pro-guns
how many deaths in mass stabbings vs mass shootings?),pro-guns
"[@PetitsChameaux]  After writing the above, I was surprised to look into this further and discover that firearms reporting is not uniform between the US and other nations.",pro-guns
This would also help to explain some of the supposed difference.,pro-guns
(1)  Misconceptions regarding the NRA Many of those proposing new firearms legislation have openly argued that the NRA has kept the US from enacting “common sense” legislation.,pro-guns
This reflects a misunderstanding of the nature and character of the NRA  The NRA is not owned by or controlled by the firearms industry.,pro-guns
It is composed of individuals within the US who have chosen to join and/or donate to this organization.,pro-guns
"The result is that the NRA, as a lobbying organization, represents a large voting block within the US.",pro-guns
"Because the NRA represents large numbers of constituents, politicians listen.",pro-guns
"More than that, the reason why the NRA has kept so many “common sense” gun reforms from taking place is that … they were never “common sense” in the first place.",pro-guns
"As we’ve discussed above, either these proposed “common sense” ideas would have no effect, or worse they would further magnify the problem.",pro-guns
"In many cases, they would also punish the innocent.",pro-guns
"As a result, the reason “gun control” legislation has not passed within the US in recent years is not because of the NRA.",pro-guns
Rather it has been because the proposed legislation hasn’t been worth the paper it was written on.,pro-guns
"Conclusion Murder is not unique to the US  Gun control laws appear to only make this problem worse  Murders can be and have been stopped with an armed response, whether by the police or some other good and willing citizen  Turning public schools into Gun Free Zones) has so far only delayed such an armed response, and therefore has only magnified the problem.",pro-guns
"If “gun control” laws won’t help this problem, what will?",pro-guns
What will stop our children from acquiring firearms and attempting mass murders in the first place?,pro-guns
"If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.",pro-guns
"(2Ch 7:14)  If this is an issue you care about, then please join me in prayer, in seeking His face, in turning from our own wicked ways.",pro-guns
Because this is one of those things that only God Almighty can truly solve.,pro-guns
KEY TAKEAWAYS Most commonly proposed gun-control measures are already ineffective at preventing mass public shootings in states where they are currently implemented.,pro-guns
"Strict gun control may be the go-to response of many, but it's simply not the answer to the problem of mass public shootings.",pro-guns
"We do not effectively combat gun violence by broadly restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens, thereby hindering their ability to defend themselves and others.",pro-guns
Copied  We all know the script by now: A mass public shooting occurs.,pro-guns
Grief and anger ensue.,pro-guns
Calls for stricter gun laws soon follow.,pro-guns
"Given how incredibly upsetting these crimes are, and how deeply they shake their communities -- and the nation itself -- such calls are perfectly understandable.",pro-guns
"If we're truly serious, however, about reducing gun violence rates and increasing personal safety, we must ensure that policy decisions are made with an eye toward facts and reality, not panic and outrage.",pro-guns
"The facts tell us that most commonly proposed gun-control measures are already ineffective at preventing mass public shootings in states where they are currently implemented, and that they will continue to be ineffective at preventing future tragedies.",pro-guns
"Although some gun-control advocates claim there have been more than 300 ""mass shootings"" this year, that number is a product of using deceptive and largely meaningless definitions that include incidents far removed from the context commonly associated with the term.",pro-guns
"Since Jan. 1, 2018, there have been 11 mass public shootings in which three or more people other than the shooter were killed, parameters derived from Congress's definitions of ""mass shooting"" and ""mass killing.""",pro-guns
"These 11 mass public shootings occurred across 7 different states, but three occurred in California, the only state with an ""A"" rating from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.",pro-guns
"Two more occurred in Maryland, with an ""A-"" rating.",pro-guns
"Another two occurred in Pennsylvania, whose ""C"" rating still accounts for the 13th strictest gun-control framework in the country.",pro-guns
"Strict gun control may be the go-to response of many, but it's simply not the answer to the problem of mass public shootings.",pro-guns
"In fact, since 2000, 17 percent of mass public shootings have occurred in California, even though the state accounts for only 12 percent of the nation's population.",pro-guns
"Texas, meanwhile, has an ""F"" gun control rating, yet has seen only 6.6 percent of total mass public shootings since 2000 -- below its expected share, given that it holds 8.6 percent of the national population.",pro-guns
"On the other hand, Washington state -- with a ""B"" rating -- accounts for 2.2 percent of the population but 8 percent of mass public shootings since 2000.",pro-guns
"More importantly, the general availability of guns doesn't appear to be the problem.",pro-guns
"Since 1990, the number of firearms per capita in the United States has increased by 50 percent.",pro-guns
"At the same time, however, the national homicide rate and national gun-homicide rate have plummeted by 50 percent, and the number of non-fatal firearm crimes committed in 2011 was one-sixth the number committed in 1993.",pro-guns
"On the whole, the increasing availability of firearms has not been related to increases in violent crime.",pro-guns
"Mass public shootings rightly terrify us, but they remain statistically very rare.",pro-guns
"The same is true of firearm deaths related to the use of semi-automatic ""assault weapons.""",pro-guns
"You are, in fact, three times more likely to be beaten to death with hands and feet than you are to be shot to death with a rifle of any kind.",pro-guns
"That does not mean we should not continue to find ways to remove firearms from the hands of individuals who show themselves, by their actions, to be a heightened risk of violence to themselves or others.",pro-guns
"It does mean, however, that rational gun policies should not demonize particular types of firearms rarely used by criminals but commonly used by millions of law-abiding citizens for a variety of lawful reasons -- including self-defense.",pro-guns
"We do not effectively combat gun violence by broadly restricting the rights of law-abiding citizens, thereby hindering their ability to defend themselves and others from violence.",pro-guns
"Rather, we must focus more intently on the major underlying causes of the gun violence: untreated mental health problems that increase the risk of suicide and interpersonal violence, gang and drug activity that drive illegal black market firearm transfers, and the lack of economic and educational opportunities that lead to cycles of poverty and crime.",pro-guns
"We must also increase the ability of law-abiding citizens to choose where and how and with what means to best defend themselves and their families from criminals who do not care to follow laws generally, and gun control laws in particular.",pro-guns
"Last week, when an Illinois man killed five of his co-workers and injured several police officers, he did so with an illegal firearm.",pro-guns
The shooter purchased the gun after lying on his background check about a past felony for aggravated assault.,pro-guns
"Like many other mass shootings, the criminal was able to carry out an act of violence not because of a lack of gun laws, but because of a bureaucratic failure to enforce the existing ones.",pro-guns
"The Aurora shooter answered “No” to the question, “Have you ever been convicted of a felony?” He was then approved for his Firearm Owner’s Identification Card (FOID), which is required before purchasing a firearm or ammunition in Illinois.",pro-guns
He then passed another background check before purchasing the .40-caliber Smith & Wesson he used on his killing rampage last week in Aurora.,pro-guns
Both background checks failed to flag his felony conviction and prison sentence from the mid-1990s in Mississippi.,pro-guns
Police reports say he hit a former girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbed her with a knife.,pro-guns
It wasn’t until Gary Martin later applied for a concealed carry permit that his felony was flagged and his FOID card revoked.,pro-guns
"He was sent a letter with orders to surrender his firearm but never did so, and it’s unclear if any police agency ever followed up.",pro-guns
"The Illinois State Police has yet to explain how their database missed his past convictions, or whether any measures were taken to seize his firearm after his FOID card was revoked.",pro-guns
The Chicago Tribune reports there is no record of law enforcement asking the court for permission to search for Martin’s gun.,pro-guns
"In a statement on Monday, Aurora police Chief Kristen Ziman said a criminal background check would not necessarily detect a 20-year-old conviction.",pro-guns
But The Chicago Tribune and news outlets were easily able to find Martin’s aggravated assault in public records.,pro-guns
All licensed gun retailers are required to run a background check through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) any time they sell a firearm to an individual.,pro-guns
But a background check system is only as effective as its database.,pro-guns
"The federal government cannot force states to submit prohibited information, like criminal and mental health records, to NICS.",pro-guns
"Unfortunately, far too many states fail to participate, and Illinois ranks 34th of states submitting records to NICS.",pro-guns
"In 2011, an audit of Illinois’ FOID card program found “significant deficiencies in the reporting of individuals with potentially disqualifying mental health conditions” to state police.",pro-guns
"At the time of the audit, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart asked, “How are people going to explain away the fact that a horrific event occurred, and it turns out this person had diagnosed mental health issues and their card was not (taken away or) the information was never forwarded to the state police, so they never had the ability to take the card away?” Nine years later, this exact scenario has played out too many times.",pro-guns
"Since the 2011 audit, Illinois has received millions of dollars in grants specifically for fixing problems with their database and automating the process of submitting disqualifying records to the NICS database.",pro-guns
"In 2018, Congress passed the Fix NICS Act, which required all federal agencies to submit any of their prohibitory records, and provided funding and resources for states to do the same (although the federal government still cannot compel states to do this).",pro-guns
This leaves many unanswered questions as to why states like Illinois continue to allow criminals to skirt gun laws already on the books.,pro-guns
"Is their failure to run background checks, or to submit records to the NICS, because of a lack of funding?",pro-guns
A lack of technology?,pro-guns
"Are they continually updating their submitted records, or are they submitted in a one-time dump to the federal government?",pro-guns
"In the case of the Aurora shooting, was it Mississippi’s failure to submit the information of the shooter’s felony, or was it Illinois’ failure to find it?",pro-guns
"The Charleston church shooting, the Sutherland Springs church shooting, and now the Aurora shooting are just three of the many recent mass shootings that could have been prevented had the background check system been properly enforced.",pro-guns
"In each of these tragedies, the shooters obtained firearms illegally.",pro-guns
They were criminals before they even claimed a victim.,pro-guns
"These criminals are evidence that gun control measures do nothing to address the reality that criminals will never obey the law, but expose bureaucratic failures to enforce it.",pro-guns
"Gun control laws are not effective The answer to the gun violence epidemic is not more gun control, which is ineffective and unconstitutional.",pro-guns
"I recently read an opinion piece called ""Why We Need Gun Control Now"" by Ally Graham, in which she claims that she wants an open conversation about gun control.",pro-guns
So that's where I come in.,pro-guns
"I am pro-gun myself, so I’m more than happy to discuss the issue.",pro-guns
"First, it’s important to go over some basic gun terminology.",pro-guns
"Semi-automatic may sound scary, but really what it means is one pull of the trigger equals one bullet fired from the gun.",pro-guns
"While it’s hard to say for sure, it’s likely that 80% or more of the guns in the U.S alone are semi-automatic.",pro-guns
"So a ban on these weapons in the U.S. would be impractical and unconstitutional, as ruled in D.C. V. Heller.",pro-guns
"Graham also discusses the recent New Zealand law banning ""assault-style weapons"", which is incredibly ambiguous.",pro-guns
The legal definition of assault weapons dates back to the 1980's in California State law.,pro-guns
"And again, it was ambiguous.",pro-guns
"The legal definition of assault weapon, however, does not refer to any actual function of a firearm.",pro-guns
Mainly it refers to various features of the weapon.,pro-guns
"Graham also discusses a recent spike in “mass shootings”, though there is no agreed upon definition what a mass shooting is.",pro-guns
"But for the most part, it refers to a shooting that involved four or more people.",pro-guns
"Though if you look at the data, in over half of the shootings, no one died.",pro-guns
"Statically speaking, mass shootings are rare and the likelihood of you dying in one is low and they make up less than 1% of all gun violence in the U.S. And according to the FBI, knives kill more people than rifles.",pro-guns
"Additionally, according to the CDC, guns save far more lives than they kill and that's not just people shooting criminals, that includes people just brandishing guns or cocking a shotgun to scare off any would-be criminals.",pro-guns
Not to mention the overall trend of crime rates lowering over the years.,pro-guns
The majority of gun crime/violence in the U.S. is either drug or gang related.,pro-guns
"I believe gun control laws are largely ineffective, and to prove this, it’s helpful to compare the U.S. to the U.K.",pro-guns
The U.K. has much stricter gun laws than the U.S. And knife crime is far more prominent in the UK than it is in the U.S.,pro-guns
"In fact, many British MP's are proposing knife control laws.",pro-guns
"Same with so called ""acid attacks"" and MP's proposing laws to control certain cleaning chemicals.",pro-guns
You can buy the ingredients for mustard gas at most retail stores in both the U.K. and U.S. My point is that evil always finds a way to do evil.,pro-guns
Did you know that the majority of break-ins in the U.S. happen when the victim is not at home?,pro-guns
And the majority of break-ins in the U.K. happen while the victim is home.,pro-guns
"A likely explanation is that because would-be criminals in the U.S. know the victim is likely to be armed, the robber picks a time when they will be safe from this risk.",pro-guns
"Some may also cite the Australian gun buyback as a success, but it was not.",pro-guns
"After the gun buyback, crime decreased at the normal expected rate.",pro-guns
"Graham also says that the New Zealand Prime Minister’s actions were "" brave and rational"".",pro-guns
My question is why?,pro-guns
How does taking away people's liberties make people safe?,pro-guns
"To quote Benjamin Franklin, ""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""",pro-guns
"I believe that rights come first from principles, meaning they come from a higher power or can be reasoned to by any person.",pro-guns
"There is no right to ""feel safe in public"" like Graham claims.",pro-guns
"If you feel unsafe, why not buy a firearm to protect yourself?",pro-guns
You have the right to do so after all.,pro-guns
Why take away my right and why not expand yours?,pro-guns
How will laws that criminals don't follow and will always find a way around keep me safe?,pro-guns
The majority of gun criminals get their guns illegally.,pro-guns
There is no legal solution that will work to stop mass shootings.,pro-guns
"You can never fully stop evil, you can only mitigate it.",pro-guns
So why not let people prepare for evil by arming themselves?,pro-guns
There are two main reasons that are theorized to be the cause of most mass shootings.,pro-guns
The first is social isolation.,pro-guns
"In many instances, the perpetrator of a mass shooting was a loner who felt isolated, so they become bitter and resentful.",pro-guns
"As a result, they want to cause as much harm to the world that wronged them as possible.",pro-guns
The second is fame.,pro-guns
Shooters know they will have an impact on the world and will be recognized internationally.,pro-guns
It is suggested to every major news outlet to never publish the name and face of the shooter for this reason.,pro-guns
"At the end of the day, I support better and stricter enforcement of the gun laws we currently have on the books, but that is a fairly big task considering that there are so many guns in the U.S.",pro-guns
Strict gun control will never work in America.,pro-guns
"Following the tragic shooting in Las Vegas, anti-gun activists have once again started to call for much stricter gun-control measures, which they say will keep Americans safer.",pro-guns
Some have even suggested the Second Amendment should be altered or abolished.,pro-guns
"Although many who want the government to impose harsh gun laws have their hearts in the right place, the evidence clearly shows gun-control laws don’t work, and even if they did, they could never realistically be enforced nationwide.",pro-guns
"Gun-control advocates say that if laws made it much more difficult to purchase firearms and if more firearms were banned, people would be safer.",pro-guns
"But based on state-level crime data, this claim is obviously false.",pro-guns
"For instance, many of the states with the lowest crime rates, including homicide rates, also have some of the fewest limits on gun ownership.",pro-guns
"In fact, the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that supports enhancing gun-control laws, gave in its recent gun-control report card “F” grades (for having lax gun laws) to five of the six states that have the lowest homicide rates.",pro-guns
"If having fewer gun restrictions causes more violent crime, why would many states with the lowest homicide rates also have relatively few gun-control laws?",pro-guns
The data also show there is no connection to higher gun ownership rates and greater amounts of crime.,pro-guns
"There are only six states in which 50 percent of the households own firearms: Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming.",pro-guns
"If gun-control supporters are correct about the dangers of firearms, these states should have significantly higher crime rates, but the opposite is true here as well.",pro-guns
Data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show four of those six states ranked in the top half of all states for having the lowest homicide rates.,pro-guns
"Two of the states, Idaho and Wyoming, ranked in the top six.",pro-guns
"Further, many cities with very low legal gun ownership rates and stringent gun-control laws, such as Chicago, have extremely high gun-related murder rates.",pro-guns
Gun-control laws also don’t prevent mass shootings.,pro-guns
An analysis conducted by statistician Leah Libresco shows Australia and Britain have not experienced fewer mass shootings or gun-related crimes since enacting their very strict gun-control laws.,pro-guns
"Even if it could be proven gun control does prevent violent crime from occurring, enforcing sweeping gun-control legislation in the United States would be virtually impossible.",pro-guns
"There are about 270 million guns in America, and in 29 states, at least one-third of the households own guns.",pro-guns
"How would law-enforcement officials remove tens of millions of newly banned weapons, or even know for sure who owns them?",pro-guns
Would police be expected to go door-to-door to conduct raids in suspected gun owners’ homes?,pro-guns
"In other countries with strict gun laws, lawmakers have attempted to implement buyback programs that offer cash for people who turn in banned weapons to government agents.",pro-guns
"This has little hope of working in the United States, though, where most gun owners want to keep their firearms.",pro-guns
"However, even if this were to be effective, how would the government stop newly illegal guns from flooding into the country across America’s massive, largely unguarded borders?",pro-guns
"A study published in 2013 by the Trans-Border Institute and Igarape Institute estimates an average of 253,000 firearms cross the U.S.-Mexico border every year.",pro-guns
"Earlier in 2017, the Canadian government reported it believes there are greater than 1 million prohibited guns in its country, and Canadian officials believe most of the firearms were brought there from the United States.",pro-guns
"These figures prove that without massive border-security improvements — which, ironically, most gun-control advocates oppose — there’s no way a substantial reduction in guns could ever occur.",pro-guns
"It’s also important to note that relative to other problems in our society of 320 million people, gun-related crime caused by Americans who legally own a firearm involved in the crime is virtually nonexistent.",pro-guns
"Of the 33,000 gun-related deaths that occur each year, two-thirds are suicides, and the majority of the remaining 11,000 deaths are gang-related and involve guns that were purchased illegally.",pro-guns
"By contrast, 88,000 people die every year from alcohol-linked causes.",pro-guns
"That means if you exclude suicides, alcohol is 650 percent deadlier than guns (including gang-related crime), and virtually no one is calling for another Prohibition, which, it’s worth pointing out, was a complete disaster.",pro-guns
"Instead of penalizing law-abiding gun owners, who use their firearms to save thousands of people every year, lawmakers should work to reduce crime by improving economic growth and providing additional educational opportunities — proven methods for limiting crime.",pro-guns
7 Facts on Gun Crime That Show Gun Control Doesn't Work The Left is incessantly attempting to figure out new ways to take guns from law-abiding American citizens in the name of reducing gun crime.,pro-guns
"However, the facts clearly show that gun control only exacerbates violent crime.",pro-guns
Here are seven facts proving this.,pro-guns
"Washington, D.C.’s gun ban worsened the city’s homicide rate.",pro-guns
"As The Daily Wire has previously explained:  In 1976, D.C. implemented a law that banned citizens from owning guns, as only police officers were allowed to carry firearms.",pro-guns
Those who already owned guns were allowed to keep them only if they were disassembled or trigger-locked.,pro-guns
"Trigger locks could only be removed if the owner received permission from the D.C. police, which was rare.",pro-guns
"According to prosecutor Jeffrey Shapiro, the results were not good.",pro-guns
"Annual homicides rose from 188 in 1976 to 364 in 1988, and then increased even further to 454 in 1993.",pro-guns
"The gun ban was struck down by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller, and homicides have steadily declined since then to 88 yearly murders in 2012.",pro-guns
"While Shapiro admits that there were other factors involved with the decline in homicides, lifting the gun ban clearly did not result in a rise in murders.",pro-guns
"D.C. still has some of the strictest gun laws in the country and consequently is one of the most dangerous places in the country to live, but the facts clearly show that homicides in D.C. rose after the ban was implemented and then subsequently declined after the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional.",pro-guns
The gun bans in Australia and Britain also didn’t work.,pro-guns
Australia and Britain are both hailed by the Left as evidence that gun control works.,pro-guns
"However, the facts tell a different story.",pro-guns
Two studies – a 2007 British Journal of Criminology study and a 2008 University of Melbourne study – concluded that Australia’s temporary gun ban had no effect on the gun homicide rate.,pro-guns
Crime Research Prevention Center president John Lott had similar findings.,pro-guns
"“Prior to 1996, there was already a clear downward [trend] in firearm homicides, and this pattern continued after the buyback,” wrote Lott.",pro-guns
"“It is hence difficult to link the decline to the buyback.”  “Again, as with suicides, both non-firearm and firearm homicides fell by similar amounts,” Lott continued.",pro-guns
"“In fact, the trend in non-firearms homicides shows a much larger decline between the pre- and post-buyback periods.",pro-guns
This suggests that crime has been falling for other reasons.,pro-guns
"Note that the change in homicides doesn’t follow the change in gun ownership – there is no increase in homicides as gun ownership gradually increased.”  In Britain’s case, the Crime Research Prevention Center found that after the gun ban was implemented, there was initially a severe increase in the homicide rate, followed by a gradual decline once Britain beefed up their police force.",pro-guns
"However, there has only been one year where the homicide rate was lower than it was pre-ban:     Additionally, there was an 89 percent spike in gun crime from 1998/1999 to 2008/2009, all of which occurred after the gun ban.",pro-guns
A closer look at the actual facts show that the Left’s favorite examples of Britain and Australia are actually examples of how gun control doesn’t work.,pro-guns
The vast majority of mass shootings occur in gun-free zones.,pro-guns
"The Crime Research Prevention Center determined that since 1950, nearly 99 percent of mass public shootings have occurred in gun-free zones.",pro-guns
"The terror attack in Orlando, FL and the shooting that murdered singer Christina Grimmie in June also took place in gun-free zones.",pro-guns
"The reason is obvious: deranged murderers want to be in a position to murder as many as possible, so they target areas where they’re least likely to find armed resistance, which happen to be gun-free zones.",pro-guns
"As Lott points out, there are 320 million people in America but only 628,000 police officers, so it’s impossible for the police to protect everybody.",pro-guns
That’s why it’s prudent for citizens to arm themselves.,pro-guns
"According to Lott, there is a clear correlation between higher firearm ownership and reducing police killings.",pro-guns
The conclusion he came to was that there is a 3.6 percent decrease in police killings for every percentage point increase in those owning a firearm.,pro-guns
"Naturally, the inverse was also true: Lott found that “from 2013 to 2015, the six states (plus the District of Columbia) that banned open carry actually experienced higher rates of police death (20.2 versus 17.3 per 100,000 officers).”  No wonder a recent National Association of Chiefs of Police survey found that 86.4 percent of 20,000 police chiefs and sheriffs support concealed carry and are overwhelmingly against further gun control.",pro-guns
"In light of the recent murders of cops, it has become even more important to have an armed citizenry.",pro-guns
There is also a correlation between fewer mass public shootings and higher gun ownership.,pro-guns
"According to Lott and the University of Chicago’s Bill Landes, between 1977 and 1999 “right-to-carry laws reduced both the frequency and the severity of mass public shootings; and to the extent to which mass shootings still occurred, they took place in those tiny areas in the states where permitted concealed handguns were not allowed.”  6.",pro-guns
"As the number of guns per person has increased, gun violence has declined.",pro-guns
"This is according to the Centers for Disease Control, which found that gun ownership increased by 56 percent, and yet gun violence declined by almost 50 percent between 1993 and 2003.",pro-guns
"If the premise of gun control zealots were correct, then wouldn’t gun violence have increased during that period of time?",pro-guns
The number of defensive gun uses are higher than the number of criminal firearm uses.,pro-guns
"There was a range of 500,000 to over 3 million defensive gun uses in 2013, according to research from the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council published by the CDC.",pro-guns
"That same year, there were 11,208 firearm homicides and 414,562 nonfatal illegal gun uses, according to the CDC and National Justice Institute, respectively.",pro-guns
"Even when taking the low end of the defensive gun uses, it’s clear that there are more defensive gun uses than criminal gun uses by Americans.",pro-guns
New Zealand gun ban is not the answer to stop mass shootings.,pro-guns
"When 50 people are sadistically murdered in a house of worship, the public understandably demands action.",pro-guns
"The recent mass shooting at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, is but the latest example of this immediate reaction to horrific tragedy.",pro-guns
It has prompted New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to announce her plan for a sweeping ban on all semiautomatic and “military style” firearms across her country.,pro-guns
"This is the kind of dramatic action that gun control advocates will often demand in other countries that experience mass shootings, including here in America.",pro-guns
"Assuming the proposal by Ardern becomes law, New Zealand would declare private ownership of semiautomatic weapons to be illegal, mandate a buyback program, prohibit high capacity magazines, eliminate firearms conversion kits, and block future sales of such firearms.",pro-guns
"This is a well intended move that the government of New Zealand, without a constitutional right to bear arms, is within its legal right to enact for its citizens.",pro-guns
But the efficacy of these measures is a truly different matter.,pro-guns
The ban on owning semiautomatic firearms in New Zealand is unlikely to prevent violence or stop any mass shootings in that country.,pro-guns
"Moreover, this proposal would be absolutely impossible to implement in America.",pro-guns
"History and statistics show that New Zealand does not have a significant gun violence problem, and despite the recent Christchurch tragedy, mass shootings are almost nonexistent in stretching back for decades.",pro-guns
"New Zealand has close to five million residents, has an estimated 1.5 million firearms in circulation, and had a grand total of 48 homicides nationwide in 2017.",pro-guns
It had been the lowest murder rate in New Zealand in 40 years.,pro-guns
The Christchurch murderer needed only a handful of weapons to kill 50 people.,pro-guns
"Putting that aside, there will always be methods in free society to engage in mass casualty terrorism.",pro-guns
Just think of the vehicle attacks and improvised explosive devices we have witnessed in recent years.,pro-guns
There is no realistic scenario where all privately held firearms will be turned over to authorities.,pro-guns
"A single handgun or rifle can be used to kill dozens of people, and it is simply not feasible to prevent a determined shooter from buying such firearms on the black market or smuggling them into the country.",pro-guns
Many proponents of the New Zealand firearms ban point to the 1996 gun buyback program in Australia as a key model to replicate.,pro-guns
"The political circumstances were certainly very similar, as the Port Arthur massacre in Australia spurred a major overhaul of gun laws in that country.",pro-guns
"However, despite massive public support for action, including for a special tax to purchase back the weapons, estimates show that Australian authorities managed to remove only about a third of guns out of their circulation.",pro-guns
"Close to a million guns were turned in over the course of the program, and at least two million guns remained in private hands.",pro-guns
"In 2017 alone, Australian authorities initiated a renewed push to confiscate “grey market” weapons, meaning those that households had kept in defiance of the 1996 ban.",pro-guns
"They were able to retrieve about 57,000 weapons in that category.",pro-guns
"In fact, there are more privately held guns in Australia today than there were before the 1996 ban had gone into effect.",pro-guns
"Despite this surge in gun ownership, the overall gun violence rate has also steadily declined there, according to government data.",pro-guns
"Not only was the gun buyback program ineffective, it was unnecessary.",pro-guns
Neither Australia nor New Zealand are models of gun control success that America should or could even try to replicate.,pro-guns
Any similar gun control efforts here would fail spectacularly.,pro-guns
"Instituting a national program of gun bans and buybacks would a political, legal, and logistical nightmare.",pro-guns
The Second Amendment is the obvious constitutional stumbling block for outright bans of weapons owned in “common usage.” There are around 100 million households that currently own firearms in America and close to 400 million guns in total circulation.,pro-guns
Going door to door to take guns away from Americans would be a fruitless and incredibly dangerous exercise for the federal government.,pro-guns
Locking up Americans for refusing to turn over newly banned weapons in common usage would be tyrannical.,pro-guns
"At the end of the day, dedicated criminals and mass murderers will find a way to kill innocent people, regardless of how many laws against firearms that any legislative body successfully passes.",pro-guns
We all want to prevent the next mass shooting tragedy.,pro-guns
"However, policy decisions should be based on evidence, not on emotion.",pro-guns
New Zealand should look to the data in Australia and note that draconian gun bans simply do not work.,pro-guns

"Anti-Immigrant Arguments Against Immigration Reform Since a bipartisan group of senators, known as the ""Gang of Eight,"" introduced the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 (also called the immigration reform bill S 744) on April 16, the anti-immigrant movement has worked to derail progress on the bill.",anti-immigration

"Anti-immigrant groups assert that the unemployment rate is very high and as more immigrants become documented, the more they will compete for jobs with Americans.",anti-immigration
"Historically, the anti-immigrant movement has attempted to co-opt issues and groups such as labor.",anti-immigration
"The movement founded a front group called the Coalition for the Future American Worker in the 2000s, which was comprised of numerous anti-immigrant organizations.",anti-immigration
"In the current battle to defeat immigration reform, the anti-immigrant movement is again targeting organized labor, like the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), claiming it does not represent the American worker because of the AFL-CIO's support of immigration reform.",anti-immigration

"William Gheen, the founder of the North Carolina-based anti-immigrant group Americans for Legal Immigration PAC (ALIPAC), wrote in an April 17 press release after the introduction of the bill, ""We believe that this bill will hurt American workers, taxpayers, students, and voters by both destroying our future abilities to control our borders and by encouraging more illegal immigration into our suffering nation!""",anti-immigration
"The Virginia-based anti-immigrant group Americans for Immigration Control (AIC) wrote the following in an email to supporters on April 18, ""Also, on top of the amnesty is a massive increase in legal immigration and guest workers to take American jobs—this at a time when 20 million Americans can't find full-time employment.""",anti-immigration
"Attacking ""cheap labor"" In addition to its claim to be standing up for the ""American worker,"" the anti-immigrant movement consistently targets the big business community for its support of immigration reform.",anti-immigration

Focus on border security The anti-immigrant movement also claims that the immigration reform bill's enforcement and border security measures should be implemented up front and not over a period of time.,anti-immigration
Many argue that providing undocumented immigrants with a pathway to citizenship will make our border less secure.,anti-immigration
"By focusing on what they perceive as border security problems they have also tried to bridge immigration with the issue of terrorism:  In an April 16 press release, Dan Stein argued, ""Simply put, Congress has no business even introducing amnesty legislation until the Obama administration secures the border, sets forth clear and transparent metrics to measure its success, and demonstrates to the American people it is serious about enforcing our immigration laws across the country.",anti-immigration
"Border security and the rule of law should not be held hostage to amnesty for illegal aliens.""",anti-immigration
"Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA), a co-chair of FAIR's board of advisors, claimed the following in April 18 McClatchy article when asked for his opinion on the bill, ""We have immigration laws for two reasons.",anti-immigration
"One, to protect our national security.",anti-immigration
"Two, to protect American jobs.",anti-immigration
The proposal of the Senate Gang of Eight violates both of those principles.,anti-immigration

"In an April 24 blog for National Review Online, Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), claimed, ""Last week's bombings were a bloody reminder that our immigration-security efforts leave much to be desired.",anti-immigration
"And this bill either ignores many of those concerns, or makes them worse.""",anti-immigration
Pushing for limits on legal immigration It is well-known that the anti-immigrant movement in the United States is opposed to undocumented immigration.,anti-immigration
"It is less widely reported that the movement is also in favor of lowering the number of ""legal"" immigrants admitted into the country each year.",anti-immigration
"FAIR takes this one step further, calling for a moratorium on all immigration to the United States.",anti-immigration
"After the introduction of the immigration reform bill, many anti-immigrant groups argued that the bill would result in large increases in ""legal"" immigration:  Ric Oberlink, a spokesperson for the Santa Barbara-based anti-immigrant group Californians for Population Stabilization (CAPS), told the Los Angeles Times on April 16, ""When we have massive unemployment in the U.S., I don't think we need to be increasing immigration and bringing in people to take jobs when there are American citizens and legal immigrants who need jobs.""",anti-immigration
"NumbersUSA published an update on its website on April 16 alleging, ""The bill could result in an additional 15 million green cards being issued in the first 10 years above and beyond the 1.1 million green cards that are currently issued each year.",anti-immigration
"That would result in more than a 150% increase in legal immigration over the first decade after the bill's passage.""",anti-immigration

"Current legal immigration totals about 1 million annually.""",anti-immigration
"The Case Against Immigration Why the United States Should Look Out for Itself  Outlining his position on immigration in August of last year, Donald Trump, then the Republican candidate for U.S. president, made his motivating philosophy clear: ""There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well-being of the American people.""",anti-immigration
"Although this nationalistic appeal may strike some readers as conservative, it is very similar to the position taken by U.S. civil rights icon and Democrat Barbara Jordan, who before her death in 1996 headed President Bill Clinton's commission on immigration reform.",anti-immigration
"""It is both a right and a responsibility of a democratic society,"" she argued, ""to manage immigration so that it serves the national interest.""",anti-immigration
"Trump's rhetoric has of course been overheated and insensitive at times, but his view on immigration — that it should be designed to benefit the receiving country — is widely held.",anti-immigration
"In the United States, there is strong evidence that the national interest has not been well served by the country's immigration policy over the last five decades.",anti-immigration
"Even as levels of immigration have approached historic highs, debate on the topic has been subdued, and policymakers and opinion leaders in both parties have tended to overstate the benefits and understate or ignore the costs of immigration.",anti-immigration
"It would make a great deal of sense for the country to reform its immigration policies by more vigorously enforcing existing laws, and by moving away from the current system, which primarily admits immigrants based on family relationships, toward one based on the interests of Americans.",anti-immigration
"IMMIGRANT NATION  Trump did not create the strong dissatisfaction with immigration felt by his working-class supporters, but he certainly harnessed it.",anti-immigration
"Voters' sense that he would restrict immigration may be the single most important factor that helped him win the longtime Democratic stronghold of the industrial Midwest, and thus the presidency.",anti-immigration
"There are two primary reasons why immigration has become so controversial, and why Trump's message resonated.",anti-immigration
The first is lax enforcement and the subsequently large population of immigrants living in the country illegally.,anti-immigration
"But although illegal immigration grabs most of the headlines, a second factor makes many Americans uncomfortable with the current policy.",anti-immigration
"It is the sheer number of immigrants, legal or otherwise.",anti-immigration
"The United States currently grants one million immigrants lawful permanent residence (or a ""green card"") each year, which means that they can stay as long as they wish and become citizens after five years, or three if they are married to a U.S. citizen.",anti-immigration
"Roughly 700,000 long-term visitors, mostly guest workers and foreign students, come annually as well.",anti-immigration
"Such a large annual influx adds up: In 2015, data from the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that 43.3 million immigrants lived in the country — double the number from 1990.",anti-immigration
"The census data include roughly 10 million illegal immigrants, while roughly a million more go uncounted.",anti-immigration
"In contrast to most countries, the United States grants citizenship to everyone born on its soil, including the children of tourists or illegal immigrants, so the above figures do not include any U.S.-born children of immigrants.",anti-immigration
"Proponents of immigration to the United States often contend that the country is a ""nation of immigrants,"" and certainly immigration has played an important role in American history.",anti-immigration
"Nevertheless, immigrants currently represent 13.5 percent of the total U.S. population, the highest percentage in over 100 years.",anti-immigration
"The Census Bureau projects that by 2025, the immigrant share of the population will reach 15 percent, surpassing the United States' all-time high of 14.8 percent, reached in 1890.",anti-immigration
"Without a change in policy, that share will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century.",anti-immigration
"Counting immigrants plus their descendants, the Pew Research Center estimates that since 1965, when the United States liberalized its laws, immigration has added 72 million people to the country — a number larger than the current population of France.",anti-immigration
"Given these numbers, it is striking that public officials in the United States have focused almost exclusively on the country's 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants, who account for only one quarter of the total immigrant population.",anti-immigration
"Legal immigration has a much larger impact on the United States, yet the country's leaders have seldom asked the big questions.",anti-immigration
"What, for example, is the absorption capacity of the nation's schools and infrastructure?",anti-immigration
How will the least-skilled Americans fare in labor market competition with immigrants?,anti-immigration
"Or, perhaps most importantly, how many immigrants can the United States assimilate into its culture?",anti-immigration
"Trump has not always approached these questions carefully, or with much sensitivity, but to his credit he has at least raised them.",anti-immigration
"TIMES CHANGE  Regarding cultural assimilation, advocates of open immigration policies often argue that there is no problem.",anti-immigration
"During the last great wave of immigration, from roughly 1880 to 1920, Americans feared the newcomers would not blend in, but for the most part they ended up assimilating.",anti-immigration
"Therefore, as this reasoning goes, all immigrants will assimilate.",anti-immigration
"Unfortunately, however, circumstances that helped Great Wave immigrants assimilate are not present today.",anti-immigration
"First, World War I and then legislation in the early 1920s dramatically reduced new arrivals.",anti-immigration
"By 1970 less than 5 percent of the U.S. population was foreign-born, down from 14.7 percent in 1910.",anti-immigration
"This reduction helped immigrant communities assimilate, as they were no longer continually refreshed by new arrivals from the old country.",anti-immigration
"But in recent decades, the dramatic growth of immigrant enclaves has likely slowed the pace of assimilation.",anti-immigration
"Second, many of today's immigrants, like those of the past, have modest education levels, but unlike in the past, the modern U.S. economy has fewer good jobs for unskilled workers.",anti-immigration
"Partly for this reason, immigrants do not improve their economic situation over time as much as they did in the past.",anti-immigration
"Third, technology allows immigrants to preserve ties with the homeland in ways that were not possible a century ago.",anti-immigration
"Calling, texting, emailing, FaceTiming, and traveling home are all relatively cheap and easy.",anti-immigration
"Fourth, the United States' attitude toward newcomers has also changed.",anti-immigration
"In the past, there was more of a consensus about the desirability of assimilation.",anti-immigration
"Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, the son of Jewish immigrants, said in a 1915 speech on ""True Americanism"" that immigrants needed to do more than just learn English and native manners.",anti-immigration
"Rather, he argued, they ""must be brought into complete harmony with our ideals and aspirations.""",anti-immigration
This was a widely held belief.,anti-immigration
"In his book The Unmaking of Americans, the journalist John J. Miller has described how at the turn of the twentieth century, organizations such as the North American Civic League for Immigrants put out pamphlets celebrating the United States and helping immigrants understand and embrace the history and culture of their adopted country.",anti-immigration
"In the United States today, as in many Western countries, this kind of robust emphasis on assimilation has been replaced with multiculturalism, which holds that there is no single American culture, that immigrants and their descendants should retain their identity, and that the country should accommodate the new arrivals' culture rather than the other way around.",anti-immigration
"Bilingual education, legislative districts drawn along ethnic lines, and foreign language ballots are all efforts to change U.S. society to accommodate immigrants in a way that is very different from the past.",anti-immigration
Newcomers additionally benefit from affirmative action and diversity initiatives originally designed to help African Americans.,anti-immigration
Such race- and ethnicity-conscious measures encourage immigrants to see themselves as separate from society and in need of special treatment due to the hostility of ordinary Americans.,anti-immigration
"John Fonte, a scholar at the Hudson Institute, has argued that such policies, which encourage immigrants to retain their language and culture, make patriotic assimilation less likely.",anti-immigration
"Of course, many Americans still embrace the goal of assimilation.",anti-immigration
A recent Associated Press survey found that a majority of Americans think that their country should have an essential culture that immigrants adopt.,anti-immigration
But the kind of assimilation promoted by Brandeis and the North American Civic League no longer has elite backing.,anti-immigration
"As a result, even institutions seemingly designed to help immigrants integrate end up giving them mixed messages.",anti-immigration
"As political psychologist Stanley Renshon points out, many immigrant-based organizations today do help immigrants learn English, but they also work hard to reinforce ties to the old country.",anti-immigration
SHOW ME THE MONEY  A further area of contention in the immigration debate is its economic and fiscal impact.,anti-immigration
"Many immigrant families prosper in the United States, but a large fraction do not, adding significantly to social problems.",anti-immigration
"Nearly one-third of all U.S. children living in poverty today have an immigrant father, and immigrants and their children account for almost one in three U.S. residents without health insurance.",anti-immigration
"Despite some restrictions on new immigrants' ability to use means-tested assistance programs, some 51 percent of immigrant-headed households use the welfare system, compared to 30 percent of native households.",anti-immigration
"Of immigrant households with children, two-thirds access food assistance programs.",anti-immigration
"Cutting immigrants off from these programs would be unwise and politically impossible, but it is fair to question a system that welcomes immigrants who are so poor that they cannot feed their own children.",anti-immigration
"To be clear, most immigrants come to the United States to work.",anti-immigration
But because the U.S. legal immigration system prioritizes family relationships over job skills — and because the government has generally tolerated illegal immigration — a large share of immigrants are unskilled.,anti-immigration
"In fact, half of the adult immigrants in the United States have no education beyond high school.",anti-immigration
"Such workers generally earn low wages, which means that they rely on the welfare state even though they are working.",anti-immigration
"This past fall, an exhaustive study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that immigrants and their dependents use significantly more in public services than they pay in taxes, and the net drain could be as high as $296 billion per year.",anti-immigration
"The academies also projected the fiscal impact into the future with mixed results — four of their scenarios showed a net fiscal drain after 75 years, and four showed a net fiscal benefit.",anti-immigration
"What is clear, however, is that at present the fiscal effect is large and negative.",anti-immigration
"The study also showed, unsurprisingly, that college-educated immigrants are a net fiscal benefit, while those without a degree are typically a net fiscal drain.",anti-immigration
"Drawing on the academies' finding, the Trump administration has suggested moving to a ""merit-based"" immigration system that would select immigrants who can support themselves.",anti-immigration
Immigration has also affected the U.S. labor market.,anti-immigration
"One of the nation's leading immigration economists, Harvard's George Borjas, recently wrote in the New York Times that by increasing the supply of workers, immigration reduces wages for some Americans.",anti-immigration
"For example, only 7 percent of lawyers in the United States are immigrants, but 49 percent of maids are immigrants, as are one-third of construction laborers and grounds workers.",anti-immigration
"The losers from immigration are less-educated Americans, many of them black and Hispanic, who work in these high-immigrant occupations.",anti-immigration
The country needs to give more consideration to the impact of immigration on the poorest and least-educated Americans.,anti-immigration
Another common argument for immigration is that it will solve Western countries' main demographic problem — that of an aging population.,anti-immigration
"Immigrants, so the argument goes, will provide the next generation of workers to pay into welfare-state programs.",anti-immigration
"But to help government finances, immigrants would have to be a net fiscal benefit, which is not the case.",anti-immigration
"Furthermore, the economist Carl Schmertmann showed more than two decades ago that ""constant inflows of immigrants, even at relatively young ages, do not necessarily rejuvenate low-fertility populations ... [and] may even contribute to population aging"" Analysis by myself and several colleagues supports this conclusion.",anti-immigration
"In short, immigrants grow old like everyone else, and in the United States they tend not to have very large families.",anti-immigration
"In 2015 the median age of an immigrant was 40 years, compared to 36 for the native-born.",anti-immigration
"And the United States' overall fertility rate, including immigrants, is 1.82 children per woman, which only falls to 1.75 once immigrants are excluded.",anti-immigration
"In other words, immigrants increase the fertility rate by just 4 percent.",anti-immigration
The United States will have to look elsewhere to deal with its aging population.,anti-immigration
"A final argument in favor of immigration centers on the benefits to immigrants themselves, especially the poorest ones, who see their wages rise dramatically upon moving to the First World.",anti-immigration
"But given the scope of Third World poverty, mass immigration is not the best form of humanitarian relief.",anti-immigration
More than three billion people in the world live in poverty — earning less than $2.50 a day.,anti-immigration
"Even if legal immigration was tripled to three million people a year, the United States would still only admit about one percent of the world's poor each decade.",anti-immigration
"In contrast, development assistance could help many more people in low-income countries.",anti-immigration
THE ART OF THE DEAL?,anti-immigration
"The last time that limiting immigration was on the U.S. legislative agenda, in the mid-1990s, Barbara Jordan's commission suggested limiting family immigration and eliminating the visa lottery, which gives out visas based on chance.",anti-immigration
"Clinton first seemed to endorse the recommendations, but then reversed course after Jordan died and the political winds shifted.",anti-immigration
"The effort to lower the level of immigration was defeated in Congress by the same odd but formidable coalition of businesses, ethnic pressure groups, progressives, and libertarians that has dominated the immigration discourse from then until the Trump era.",anti-immigration
"With the election of Trump, a political compromise in the United States might be possible.",anti-immigration
It could involve legalizing some illegal immigrants in return for tightening policies on who gets to come in.,anti-immigration
Prioritizing skilled immigration while cutting overall numbers would increase the share of immigrants who are well educated and facilitate assimilation.,anti-immigration
"The RAISE Act, sponsored by Senators Tom Cotton (R-Ark.)",anti-immigration
"and David Perdue (R-Ga.), would do just that.",anti-immigration
Perhaps coupling the RAISE Act with legalization for some share of illegal immigrants could be a way forward.,anti-immigration
"Yet no matter what policy is adopted, immigration will remain contentious because it involves tradeoffs and competing moral claims.",anti-immigration
"And for the foreseeable future, the number of people who wish to come to the developed countries such as the United States will be much greater than these countries are willing or able to allow.",anti-immigration
"The real cost of illegal immigration, and it's not avocados Americans pay $200 billion annually in illegal immigration costs.",anti-immigration
"Last week, more than 1,000 immigrants surged through the U.S. southern border near El Paso, Texas — the largest number ever encountered by U.S. Border Control and Protection, with the previous record being set in the month of April, which was 424.",anti-immigration
This unprecedented invasion spurred President Donald J. Trump to slap a 5 percent tariff on goods from Mexico in an effort to get the Mexican government to take seriously the problem of undocumented immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.,anti-immigration
"The mainstream media, predictably, started lamenting on how the price of avocados for American consumers may potentially increase a few cents, and completely ignored the $200 billion American taxpayers pay each year in illegal immigration costs.",anti-immigration
"Not to mention the cost of illegal drugs on our youth, and the cost to education and health care on American taxpayers.",anti-immigration
"TOP STORIES High school history lesson compares Trump with Nazis, communists Daredevil 'Mad' Mike Hughes killed in homemade rocket crash The curious political cases where Democratic AGs jumped in to meddle  So, let’s take a look at these dollars and cents.",anti-immigration
"According to a recent analysis done by Chris Conover, an American Enterprise Institute adjunct scholar, “all told, Americans cross-subsidize health care for unauthorized immigrants to the tune of $18.5 billion a year.”  Although current federal policy prohibits federal tax funding of health care to unauthorized immigrants through Medicaid or Obamacare, “rough estimates suggest that the nation’s 3.9 million uninsured immigrants who are unauthorized likely receive about $4.6 billion in health services paid for by federal taxes, $2.8 billion in health services financed by state and local taxpayers and another $3 billion bankrolled through ‘cost-shifting,’ i.e.",anti-immigration
"higher payments by insured patients to cover hospital uncompensated care losses, and roughly $1.5 billion in physician charity care,” Mr. Conover wrote in Forbes.",anti-immigration
"Public education of illegal immigrants’ children is also hemorrhaging the American taxpayer, as under federal law, all students are eligible to receive schooling regardless of their immigration status.",anti-immigration

"In addition, illegal immigrants have succeeded in violating U.S. immigration law so that the illegal immigrant population in the U.S. is estimated to be around 11 million.",anti-immigration
"The demographic challenges affecting Social Security and Medicare should not be addressed by further increasing the current historically high level of legal immigration to the U.S., which would only increase the eventual demands on those programs and aggravate other social problems.",anti-immigration
"Instead our legal immigration program should be more narrowly focused on admitting immigrants who are most likely to make contributions to solving our challenges: immigrants holding advanced degrees in science, technology and engineering, or with demonstrated ability in business management.",anti-immigration
We should favor young immigrants with many years of work ahead of them.,anti-immigration

"Illegal Immigration is a Serious Threat to America’s National Security   Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court justices heard arguments regarding Arizona’s immigration law.",anti-immigration
"The way I see it, Arizona is simply trying to enforce our basic immigration laws that make it illegal to be in our country without a visa or proper citizenship.",anti-immigration
"With nearly 12 million illegal immigrants in this country, it is clear that our system is broken and the federal government needs to enact and enforce strict immigration laws in order to protect the citizens of our country.",anti-immigration
"The problem with illegal immigration has gone on too long, and the Arizona law is an attempt from states to address a problem that the federal government has not.",anti-immigration
"The law would allow state and local law enforcement in Arizona to enforce federal immigration statutes, but it has been struck down at the district and appeals court levels.",anti-immigration
"The hearing is a product of the administration filing a legal challenge against the new Arizona immigration law, originally claiming it is unjust because it will lead to “racial profiling”.",anti-immigration
"However, the Justice Department, under the current administration, is now arguing the law violates the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which states that the Constitution, federal laws and treaties supersede state laws.",anti-immigration

"The study tallies the impact on education, medical, justice/enforcement, welfare and other government programs.",anti-immigration
"The report notes that the $116 billion cost of illegal immigration falls on state and local taxpayers disproportionately – by a ratio of roughly 2 to 1 – with state and local expenditures totaling $88.9 billion and Federal expenditures totaling $45.8 billion, with only approximately $19 billion recouped in taxes.",anti-immigration

"All told, the nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.",anti-immigration

That's more than double the monthly average during President Donald Trump's first year in office.,anti-immigration

"Meanwhile, data from the U.S.",anti-immigration
Sentencing Commission suggest the opposite – that illegal immigrants were responsible for a disproportionate share of federal crimes between 2011 and 2016.,anti-immigration
It is impossible to definitively prove whether illegal immigrants are more or less likely to commit violent crimes.,anti-immigration
We do not even know exactly how many illegal immigrants live here.,anti-immigration
And we do not know whether they are caught by police at different rates than native-born criminals.,anti-immigration
The data are simply too unreliable to draw firm conclusions.,anti-immigration
The debate over whether illegal immigrants are more or less likely than the native-born to commit crimes distracts from two important truths.,anti-immigration
"First, no amount of crime by illegal immigrants is acceptable.",anti-immigration
"Secondly, this debate over violent crime obscures the bigger threat from illegal immigration: the massive economic burden imposed on American workers and taxpayers.",anti-immigration
Illegal immigrants compete with native-born Americans and legal immigrants for jobs.,anti-immigration
"Of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, about 8 million work.",anti-immigration
"These illegal workers, many of whom lack formal educations and English-language skills, flock to low-skilled jobs.",anti-immigration
"In fact, over the past two decades, the influx of immigrants who lack high school diplomas has swelled the low-skilled workforce by about 25 percent.",anti-immigration
This competition disproportionately harms less-educated Americans.,anti-immigration
"Each 10-percent increase in the size of the low-skilled labor force decreases workers' wages by at least 3 percent, according to research from Harvard professor George Borjas.",anti-immigration
"Competition with immigrant laborers depresses the annual wages of Americans without high school diplomas by up to $1,500.",anti-immigration
These less-skilled American workers are among the most vulnerable members of society.,anti-immigration
They already struggle to afford health care and nutritious food.,anti-immigration
"By turning a blind eye to illegal immigration, our elected officials are effectively kicking these workers while they are down.",anti-immigration
Workers are not the only ones suffering from illegal immigration.,anti-immigration
"When illegal immigrants use public services, American taxpayers are often stuck with the bill.",anti-immigration
Consider health care: More than seven in 10 illegal immigrants do not have health insurance.,anti-immigration
"When they get sick, they frequently turn to emergency rooms, which legally cannot turn patients away.",anti-immigration
The cost of that care is ultimately passed on to government programs and everyone with a private insurance plan.,anti-immigration
Americans pay about $18 billion a year to provide free and subsidized health care for illegal immigrants.,anti-immigration
The same goes for welfare and food assistance programs.,anti-immigration
Eighty-nine percent of households headed by illegal immigrant parents utilize at least one welfare program.,anti-immigration
These families draw nearly $6 billion in welfare benefits per year.,anti-immigration
Children from illegal immigrant households also strain our public-school system.,anti-immigration
Nearly a quarter of students in U.S. public schools now speak a language other than English at home – that share has more than doubled since 1980.,anti-immigration
Taxpayers shell out roughly $1.6 billion a year to teach these kids English.,anti-immigration
"All together, illegal immigration costs federal, state and local taxpayers $116 billion annually.",anti-immigration
Rising levels of illegal immigration threaten American workers and taxpayers.,anti-immigration
It's time for our elected officials to take that threat seriously.,anti-immigration
What's Wrong With Illegal Immigration?,anti-immigration
"The Costs of Illegal Immigration By draining public funds, creating unfair competition for jobs with America’s least prepared workers and thereby lowering wages and working conditions, and by imposing unwanted strains on services designed to provide assistance to Americans, illegal immigration causes harm to Americans and legal residents.",anti-immigration
Illegal Aliens' Numbers are Large and Growing FAIR estimates there are between 10-12 million illegal aliens residing in the country in 2005.,anti-immigration
"According to the Census Bureau, there were an estimated 8.7 million illegal aliens living in the United States in 2000.",anti-immigration
"According to the Migration Policy Institute, roughly 500,000 illegal aliens are added to that population every year.",anti-immigration
"The immigration authorities also estimate that there are over one million temporary illegal aliens, such as seasonal workers, here at any given time.",anti-immigration
"The population of illegal aliens would be higher, but in 1986 our government gave amnesty to nearly three million illegal aliens, allowing them to become legal members of our society, and we have allowed additional millions to gain amnesty through other loopholes.",anti-immigration
Illegal Immigration Undermines Legal Immigration.,anti-immigration
There is a list of several million eligible people waiting to be legally admitted as immigrants to our country; some of them have been on that list for many years waiting for one of the numerically limited visas to become available.,anti-immigration
Illegal immigration makes a mockery of those people's adherence to the rules and of our country's sovereignty.,anti-immigration
Illegal immigration harms the American workforce According to a study in 1996 of the costs of illegal immigration by Rice Univ.,anti-immigration
"economist, Dr. Donald Huddle, illegal aliens were displacing roughly 730,000 American workers every year, at a cost of about $4.3 billion a year, and the supply of cheap labor depresses the wages and working conditions of the working poor.",anti-immigration
The approximate doubling of the illegal alien population since the time of that estimate means that the number of jobs lost to American workers and the costs of displacement would also likely have more than doubled.,anti-immigration
"Illegal Immigration is a Burden on the Taxpayer The costs of illegal immigration to the taxpayer are numerous, but the largest costs are the education of their children, emergency medical care and incarceration for those arrested for crimes.",anti-immigration
"Despite being ineligible, some illegal aliens also get welfare the same way they get jobs: with identity documents falsely identifying them as U.S. citizens.",anti-immigration
"In addition, if they have U.S.-born children, they may collect welfare assistance in the name of those children.",anti-immigration
The annual net cost of illegal immigrants (after subtracting their tax payments) to the American taxpayer is likely to be more than $45 billion.,anti-immigration
Our study of the net fiscal “The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Californians” estimated the partial costs at $10.5 billion in that state alone.,anti-immigration
"The Number of Deportations is Low Compared to the size of the illegal alien population, the number of annual deportations is shockingly small.",anti-immigration
"In fiscal year 2003, only 186,151 aliens were formerly removed.1 Many of the deportees are caught by the police after they have committed a crime.",anti-immigration
"In FY’03, 39,600 of the deported aliens fell in that category.",anti-immigration
The federal Bureau of Prisons estimates that nearly three-tenths of its prisoners are aliens.,anti-immigration
"Recent Improvements Have Not Solved the Problem Although the number of deported illegal aliens is more than triple the average during the 1990s, we are only treading water in a rising tide.",anti-immigration
"The Department of Homeland Security has no plan for identifying and removing the bulk of the illegal alien population, whose number continues to rise.",anti-immigration
Most illegal aliens remain safe from capture and deportation unless they are arrested for a crime.,anti-immigration
"Some Aspects of INS Enforcement are Getting Worse Stung by criticism from companies about worksite raids, often accompanied by criticism from elected representatives, the immigration authorities instituted in 1998 an innovation called ""the Phoenix Plan.""",anti-immigration
"Instead of raiding a company, they informed it on the basis of a review of employment documents that they appeared to have hired illegal alien workers, giving the companies the opportunity to dismiss the workers.",anti-immigration
"When this happened, the workers were free to simply walk away with their counterfeit identity documents to another employer.",anti-immigration
"The interior immigration inspectors have only the resources to focus on a few large violators at a time, so most illegal alien workers — and the companies that employ them — get off scot-free.",anti-immigration
"Amnesty is Not the Answer As millions of illegal aliens are allowed to remain here year after year, pressure rises from immigrant advocates to grant them amnesty.",anti-immigration
But this is the equivalent of pardoning criminals en masse because it is easier than capturing them.,anti-immigration
"It encourages further illegal immigration and, by creating new ""legal"" immigrants out of old illegal ones, adds dramatically to the backlog of relatives abroad who apply for legal admission.",anti-immigration
"It also adds to the costs to the taxpayer, because when illegal aliens are given legal residence, they become eligible for additional tax-funded services.",anti-immigration
The answer is to deter further illegal immigration and to tackle the removal of the current illegal alien population by: Improving the security of personal identification systems and require verification of legal work status.,anti-immigration
"Linking government databases on births, deaths, and immigration status.",anti-immigration
Tracking foreigners on temporary visas to assure they leave when required.,anti-immigration
"Strengthening enforcement capabilities both on the border and in the interior of the country including the provision of more detention space for aliens pending deportation, and Developing additional cooperative federal-local immigration enforcement programs.",anti-immigration
Critical to the success of the deterrence of further illegal immigration and reducing the current illegal alien population is single-minded support by our elected leaders for our immigration authorities in their law enforcement efforts.,anti-immigration
Stop illegal immigration to keep Americans safe  Every state is a border state and every town is a border town.,anti-immigration
That is what many believe to be happening due to the illegal entry taking place on our nation’s southern border.,anti-immigration
What we as Tennesseans have watched happen over the past decade is a problem that has spiraled out of control for local law enforcement and elected officials.,anti-immigration
It is due to the federal government not doing its job to enforce existing federal immigration law.,anti-immigration
"The Obama administration pushed open-border policies, backed away from securing the border and pushed sanctuary city policies that have made us less safe.",anti-immigration
"When you read our nation’s Constitution, you read that our duty is to provide for the common defense.",anti-immigration
Our government is to protect our citizens.,anti-immigration
"What we have very sadly learned is that by allowing these cities and states to become a haven for those who have entered our country illegally, we make our communities less safe.",anti-immigration
"The cases of Kate Steinle, Jamiel Shaw and Mollie Tibbetts plus, unfortunately, dozens of others tell the story.",anti-immigration
Young lives lost needlessly.,anti-immigration
"Our papers are filled with the reports of MS-13 gang members being arrested, indicted for violent crimes.",anti-immigration
"Recently, MS-13 members were indicted in Nashville for murder and drug trafficking.",anti-immigration
Tennesseans ask me every day what we should do to get the issues that come from illegal immigration into our country under control.,anti-immigration
"The first steps we should take are to build the wall, end chain migration, and end the visa lottery in favor of a merit-based system.",anti-immigration
There are some other constructive steps that we can take as well.,anti-immigration
Congress should penalize governments and government officials who refuse to follow federal law by allowing their cities to become sanctuaries for illegal aliens.,anti-immigration
"If you choose to disobey the law, you should not receive federal law enforcement funding.",anti-immigration
This is a solution I have continued to put forth for over 10 years.,anti-immigration
Police also need the authority to check the immigration status of anyone arrested under suspicion of gang activity.,anti-immigration
"Gang members should be immediately deported, along with those who unlawfully entered our country and are arrested for committing violent, sexual or drug-related crimes.",anti-immigration
These are common sense measures that will make Tennessee more safe and provide greater border security.,anti-immigration
The issue of illegal immigration provides a clear policy difference between me and my opponent.,anti-immigration
"As governor, Phil Bredesen adopted policies that encouraged illegal immigration, including issuing legal driving certificates to illegal immigrants.",anti-immigration
I fought against this initiative because it openly rewarded illegal immigration and undermined the hard work of those who entered our country lawfully.,anti-immigration
"Moreover, it made Tennessee a magnet for illegal immigrants.",anti-immigration
"Giving driver's certificates to illegals is the first step toward enabling sanctuary cities, abolishing ICE, and giving amnesty to those who have broken the law.",anti-immigration
So it’s not surprising that Phil Bredesen also opposes securing the southern border.,anti-immigration
"He’s spoken out against the wall, saying that it’s just political theater.",anti-immigration
"He says he's tired of ""nibbling around the edges"" and wants to get back to big projects.",anti-immigration
What better way to start than by building the wall.,anti-immigration
"Securing our border isn’t political theater; it’s enforcing the laws of a sovereign nation, and it’s a vital step to keep Americans safe.",anti-immigration
We have seen no greater blatant disregard for the rule of law than the Abolish ICE movement from the left.,anti-immigration
"From disrupting child trafficking rings to conducting sting operations against violent gangs like MS-13, ICE works day in and day out to keep Americans safe.",anti-immigration
ICE serves an important role in combating illegal immigration and should be given the opportunity to ensure proper enforcement of federal immigration laws for the years to come.,anti-immigration
"We need to give them more resources, not take them away.",anti-immigration
The proposal to abolish such a vital agency is misguided and will result in more crime across the country.,anti-immigration
"Through stopping sanctuary cities, securing the border, increasing penalties for public officials who violate federal law, and continuing to give ICE the resources it needs to protect Americans, the United States will be much better equipped to stop illegal immigration.",anti-immigration
"As your senator, I will always support policies that keep Americans safe.",anti-immigration
“Medicare for All” Is Getting Less Popular .,oppose-medicare
Tuesday’s Democratic debate featured yet another exchange pitting the supporters of single payer or “Medicare for All” (Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders) against competitors who’d prefer a more incremental approach focused on creating a public option (largely Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar).,oppose-medicare
"* This time, the sniping mostly focused on whether taxes would have to go up to pay for “Medicare for All” (Warren was hesitant to admit it, but they will, though the pro camp says families will save money on copays and deductibles), and whether it could realistically pass.",oppose-medicare
Aside from the tone—everyone involved seemed a bit testier than usual—not much was new.,oppose-medicare
"But based on some new polling, it seems like these exchanges may be cumulatively hurting “Medicare for All’s” public popularity.",oppose-medicare
"According to the Kaiser Family Foundation’s latest Health Care Tracking poll, a small majority of adults still say they would favor putting all Americans on a single national health plan, with 51 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed.",oppose-medicare
"But the margin of support has shrunk significantly from the beginning of this year, when as many as 57 percent backed such a proposal, and only 37 percent were opposed.",oppose-medicare
Recent polling by other organizations has shown even lower levels of support for a single-payer system.,oppose-medicare
"An NBC/Wall Street Journal survey last month found just 41 percent said they backed one, with 56 percent against, while a Fox News poll found 46 percent in favor and 48 percent against.",oppose-medicare
But polling results on health care can be extremely sensitive to how the question is phrased.,oppose-medicare
"What makes the Kaiser Family Foundation survey interesting is that it’s been asking the public the same version of its question for more than two years now—“Do you favor or oppose having a national health plan, sometimes called Medicare-for-all, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan?”—giving us a picture of how public opinion has evolved.",oppose-medicare
"And it suggests that as single payer has become a more contentious political topic during the presidential campaign, it has lost a bit of its shine.",oppose-medicare
That seems to be the case across parties.,oppose-medicare
"Overall, 71 percent of Democrats, 51 percent of independents, and 28 percent of Republicans favor “Medicare for All,” according to Kaiser.",oppose-medicare
"But support is down across all three, while opposition is up.",oppose-medicare
"It’s a little tricky to read the trends, because Kaiser’s polling results have a pretty high margin of error when broken down by party (6 percent in the latest survey).",oppose-medicare
"Here’s the trend for Democrats, whose enthusiasm for single payer seems to have weakened a bit after the first presidential debates in June.",oppose-medicare
None of this is especially surprising.,oppose-medicare
"The phrase “Medicare for All” tended to poll well early on, but its popularity tended to drop once respondents were told it would require them to give up their private insurance.",oppose-medicare
That specific issue has been front and center during the Democratic debates and may have eroded some enthusiasm for the concept.,oppose-medicare
"Pure partisanship has probably kicked in a bit as well; as the primary campaign has worn on, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents may have come to associate the idea with Democratic candidates, leading them to reject it.",oppose-medicare
"There is some good news for progressives, though: While voters might be feeling a bit less eager about single payer, support for a public health insurance option seems to be widening, with 73 percent of Americans in favor, and 24 percent opposed (even a majority of Republicans approve).",oppose-medicare
"To be clear, these polls don’t necessarily mean Warren and Sanders are losing the health care debate among Democrats.",oppose-medicare
"While single payer’s support might be softening within the party, it’s still popular, and their support for it may be a net positive for their campaigns.",oppose-medicare
"But as far as the general electorate goes, both candidates seem to have hitched themselves to an idea that’s getting less popular the more voters hear about it.",oppose-medicare

"Whether you love, hate or are indifferent toward his “Medicare for All” plan, polls show Sanders leading when Democratic voters are asked which candidate they think is best able handle to health care.",oppose-medicare
"The thing is, though — according to new polling from Marist College this week — Sanders’s plan isn’t actually the most popular idea in the field.",oppose-medicare
"Instead, that distinction belongs to what Marist calls “Medicare for all that want it,” or what’s sometimes called a public option — something very similar to Joe Biden’s recently unveiled health care plan, which claims to give almost everyone “the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare.”  In the Marist poll, 90 percent of Democrats thought a plan that provided for a public option was a good idea, as compared to 64 percent who supported a Sanders-style Medicare for All plan that would replace private health insurance.",oppose-medicare
"The popularity of the public option also carries over to independent voters: 70 percent support it, as compared to 39 percent for Medicare for All.",oppose-medicare
But none of this is meant to negate what I wrote last week.,oppose-medicare
"Sanders’s plan is still fairly popular with Democrats, and there’s more to winning elections than just picking whatever policies happen to poll best; Medicare for All is consistent with the sort of revolutionary change for which Sanders advocates.",oppose-medicare
"At the same time, the public option is potentially a winning issue for Biden, and one that allows him to reinforce some of his core strengths.",oppose-medicare
"It offers greater continuity with the legacy of the Obama administration (since the public option is a more gradual change from Obamacare — not to mention, something Obamacare initially tried to include), and allows him to double down on his electability message, since it polls better than eliminating private insurance.",oppose-medicare
That may be why Biden has gone on the offense against Medicare for All.,oppose-medicare
"Stuck in the middle, as I wrote last week, are Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, who (along with other Democrats) have co-sponsored Sanders’s bill rather than developing a health care plan of their own.",oppose-medicare
"They aren’t getting credit from voters for leading on health care like Sanders, and they’re also left defending a plan that isn’t as popular as Biden’s among Democrats nor very popular among general election voters.",oppose-medicare
"We’re not in the prediction business — that’s a lie, we are — but it wouldn’t be surprising in the least if one or both of them issued their own health care plan within the next few months.",oppose-medicare
Sanders’ Medicare for All is all bad for the U.S.,oppose-medicare
"If you like your health care plan, Bernie Sanders says tough luck; he will take it away from you if elected president.",oppose-medicare
Give the Democratic candidate some credit for straight talk about his version of Medicare for All.,oppose-medicare
"But if Sanders’ plan is the gold standard - after all, he “wrote the damn bill” - it is also the most problematic, eliminating 2 million jobs and creating a system that most Americans don’t want.",oppose-medicare
Insurers Deal More Blows To Medicare For All .,oppose-medicare
"Health insurance companies are already reporting unprecedented growth in signing up seniors to their Medicare plans for 2020, which is bad news for certain Democrats pushing single payer versions of “Medicare for All.”  The nation’s largest health insurer, UnitedHealth Group, last week reported its best growth ever for enrollment in individual Medicare Advantage, the private coverage sold by health plans via contracts with the federal government.",oppose-medicare
UnitedHealth’s UnitedHealthcare health insurance unit was the first of the big health insurers to report quarterly earnings and updated 2020 projections for what is expected to be a record year of growth for Medicare Advantage.,oppose-medicare
"Other insurers including the Aetna unit of CVS Health, Anthem, Cigna and Humana will be reporting their quarterly earnings in the next two months.",oppose-medicare
"“Within our Medicare Advantage offerings including dual eligible growth, we expect to serve nearly 700,000 more people in 2020,” UnitedHealth Group chief executive David Wichmann told analysts on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call last week.",oppose-medicare
"Today In: Innovation Wichmann described the most recent open enrollment period, which ended in early December for seniors to choose their Medicare health and drug coverage for 2020, as UnitedHealth’s “strongest ever” for individual Medicare Advantage.",oppose-medicare
UnitedHealth’s record Medicare Advantage enrollment comes as most Democrats running for their party’s nomination for the Presidency back off a single payer version of Medicare for All that would uproot the private insurance industry.,oppose-medicare
And that would in effect end a Medicare Advantage program that has already signed up more than one in three Medicare eligible seniors and growing.,oppose-medicare
But more seniors signing up for private Medicare Advantage means it will be politically harder for it to be taken away and replaced with a government-run single-payer version of Medicare for All pushed most notably by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.,oppose-medicare
Sanders continues to push single payer Medicare and last week during a debate in Des Moines reiterated that his plan has no copayments or deductibles.,oppose-medicare
"Meanwhile, Democrats that include former Vice President Joe Biden and most others still in the race are touting an effort to build on existing coverage under the Affordable Care Act.",oppose-medicare
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, historically a supporter of Sanders plan, has backed off moving all Americans to a government-run healthcare system in favor of first bolstering the ACA and introducing a public option.",oppose-medicare
"As more baby boomers turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, insurers and the federal government are seeing more of them sign up for private Medicare Advantage than the government-run traditional fee-for-service Medicare.",oppose-medicare
"This year, Medicare Advantage plans are offering more supplement health benefits under new rules established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which has seen  a record number of health plans selling coverage that offers seniors the same benefits as traditional Medicare plus extras like preventative care and outpatient healthcare services.",oppose-medicare
"“We are bullish obviously overall on the outlook for both Medicare Advantage, but also the dual special needs marketplace as well,” UnitedHealth’s Wichmann said.",oppose-medicare
“They are both very larger today and growing in markets.,oppose-medicare
MA is clearly outperforming fee-for-service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction and so no surprise that it is performing as well and seems to be gaining some momentum.”  The lack of momentum for a single payer version of Medicare for All among Democrats vying to challenge President Donald Trump should Republicans re-nominate him to run for a second term isn’t lost on health plans signing up seniors to Medicare Advantage.,oppose-medicare
The health insurance industry and its supporters say Medicare Advantage is more about “modernizing” Medicare with the help of the private sector and seniors are increasingly recognizing the difference.,oppose-medicare
"“Despite the lower costs, better outcomes, and high satisfaction that defines Medicare Advantage, some would argue for policies that threaten the success of Medicare Advantage and turn back the clock on innovative care models that enable seniors to live healthier lives,” Allyson Schwartz, a former Democratic Congresswoman and president and CEO of Better Medicare Alliance wrote in an opinion column in the Jan. 7th issue of the journal Health Affairs.",oppose-medicare
"“From my time leading a women’s health center, to my work as Commissioner of Health and Human Services in Philadelphia, to my service in Congress crafting health policy on the Ways and Means Committee, to my role today, I believe health care is a basic human right,” Schwartz wrote.",oppose-medicare

The Medicare for All Act of 2019 Our dysfunctional health care system is unaffordable.,oppose-medicare
"Today, the United States has the most expensive, inefficient, and bureaucratic health care system in the world.",oppose-medicare
Despite the fact that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care for all -- and have 34 million Americans who are uninsured and even more who are underinsured -- we now spend more than twice as much per capita on health care as the average developed country.,oppose-medicare
"According to a recent study, 45 percent of Americans are worried a major illness could leave them bankrupt, 1 out of 4 Americans skipped needed medical care because they could not afford it, and 77 percent are concerned rising health costs will cause significant and lasting damage to our economy.",oppose-medicare
We spend more on health care and get worse results.,oppose-medicare
"According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, we spend more than $10,700 per capita on health care.",oppose-medicare
"Meanwhile, Canada spends just $4,826, France spends $4,902, Germany spends $5,728, and the United Kingdom spends $4,246 per person on health care.",oppose-medicare
"Further, despite the fact that health care spending consumes almost 18% of our GDP, our health care outcomes are worse than all of these other countries.",oppose-medicare
"For example, our life expectancy is 2.5 years lower than Germany's and our mortality rate for children under the age of 18 is at the top of the list compared to other developed countries.",oppose-medicare
Our current health care system puts profits over people.,oppose-medicare
"The ongoing failure of our health care system is directly attributable to the fact that - - unique among major nations -- it is primarily designed not to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, but to maximize profits for health insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and medical equipment suppliers.",oppose-medicare
"While thousands of Americans die each year because they cannot get the health care they desperately need, the top five health insurance companies last year made nearly $21 billion in profits, led by UnitedHealth which made almost $12 billion alone.",oppose-medicare
"As tens of thousands of American families face bankruptcy and financial ruin because of the outrageously high cost of health care and 30 percent of U.S. adults with private health insurance delay seeking medical care each year due to cost, the top 65 healthcare CEOs made $1.7 billion in compensation in 2017 including $83.2 million for the CEO of UnitedHealth Group; $58.7 million for the CEO of Aetna; and $43.9 million for the CEO of Cigna.",oppose-medicare
"Today, about one out of every five Americans cannot afford to fill the prescriptions given to them by their doctors because we pay, by far, the highest price in the world for prescription drugs.",oppose-medicare
"Meanwhile, last year pharmaceutical companies made over $50 billion in profits.",oppose-medicare
"A 2013 study showed that in 2010, the United States paid, on average, about double what was paid  in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Switzerland for prescription drugs.",oppose-medicare

Universal health care for all.,oppose-medicare
"The Medicare for All Act will provide comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child in our country -- without out-of-pocket expenses.",oppose-medicare
"No more insurance premiums, deductibles or co-payments.",oppose-medicare
"Further, this bill improves Medicare coverage to include dental, hearing and vision care.",oppose-medicare
"In other words, this plan would do exactly what should be done in a civilized and democratic society.",oppose-medicare
"It would allow all Americans, regardless of their income, to get the health care they need when they need it.",oppose-medicare
Medicare for All is the most cost-effective health care plan.,oppose-medicare
"Instead of doctors and nurses spending a significant part of their day filling out forms and arguing with insurance companies, they should be using their time to provide care to their patients.",oppose-medicare
We'd be able to save up to $500 billion annually in billing and administrative costs under Medicare for All.,oppose-medicare
That money could be used to greatly expand primary care in this country and make certain that all Americans got the health care they needed when they needed it -- saving billions on expensive emergency room care and hospital visits.,oppose-medicare
"Instead of paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, we could save hundreds of billions over a 10 year period through tough negotiations with the drug companies under this legislation.",oppose-medicare
"Even a study done by the right-wing Mercatus Center estimated that Medicare for All would save Americans more than $2 trillion over a decade, reducing the projected cost of health care between 2022 and 2031 from $59.7 trillion to $57.6 trillion.",oppose-medicare
Another study by the University of Massachusetts Amherst estimated that Medicare for All would save the American people even more money - $5.1 trillion over a ten year period compared to what they are spending today.,oppose-medicare
Medicare for All saves middle class families thousands of dollars.,oppose-medicare
"At a time when health care in 2018 for a typical family of four with an employer-sponsored PPO plan now costs more than $28,000, the reality is that a Medicare-for-all system would save the average family significant sums of money.",oppose-medicare

"Citizens for Tax Justice found that middle class families would see their after-tax income go up by about $3,240 a  year under Medicare for All.",oppose-medicare
Another study found that middle class families would spend about 14 percent less of their income on health care than they do today.,oppose-medicare
"Even the projections from the Mercatus Center suggest that the average American could save about $6,000 under Medicare for all over a 10-year period.",oppose-medicare
Medicare for All is good for businesses.,oppose-medicare
"A Medicare-for-all system not only benefits individuals and families, it would benefit the business community.",oppose-medicare
Small- and medium-sized businesses would be free to focus on their core business goals instead of wasting precious energy and resources navigating an incredibly complex system to provide health insurance to their employees.,oppose-medicare
"Bottom line: If every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States of America cannot do the same.",oppose-medicare
"Summary of the bill Coverage for all This legislation will create a federal universal health insurance program to provide comprehensive coverage for all Americans including inpatient and outpatient hospital care; emergency services; primary and preventive services; prescription drugs; mental health and substance abuse treatment; maternity and newborn care; pediatrics; home- and community-based long-term services and supports; dental, audiology, and vision services.",oppose-medicare

"As a patient, all your basic needs are covered.",oppose-medicare

"No deductibles, no surprise bills for out-of-network services, no copays.",oppose-medicare

"No more worrying about whether you can afford to get the care you need, or how to pick the right insurance plan for your family.",oppose-medicare
What will it mean for providers?,oppose-medicare
Health care providers can spend more time with their patients and less time with paperwork.,oppose-medicare
"A universal health care system will also allow the country to invest more resources in provider education and training, and make smart investments to avoid provider shortages and ensure communities can access the providers they need.",oppose-medicare
What will it mean for employers?,oppose-medicare
"Instead of struggling to provide health insurance to employees, businesses will simply pay a payroll tax—just like they do for Medicare now.",oppose-medicare
"More freedom, more security Under this bill, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment.",oppose-medicare
"That freedom would not only help the American people live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives, but it would also promote innovation and entrepreneurship in every sector of the economy.",oppose-medicare
"People would be able to start new businesses, stay home with their children or leave jobs they don’t like knowing that they would still have health care coverage for themselves and their families.",oppose-medicare
Employers would be free to focus on running their business rather than spending countless hours figuring out how to provide health insurance to their employees.,oppose-medicare
Working Americans wouldn’t have to choose between bargaining for higher wages or better health insurance.,oppose-medicare
Parents wouldn’t have to worry about how to provide health insurance to their children.,oppose-medicare
Seniors and people with serious or chronic illnesses could afford the care necessary to keep them healthy without worry of financial ruin.,oppose-medicare
"Millions of people will no longer have to choose between health care and other necessities like food, heat and shelter.",oppose-medicare
The Plot Against Medicare for All The political establishment rediscovers the benefit of Red-baiting and xenophobia to preserve the health care industry's buckrakers.,oppose-medicare
"Last week, at a huge and frightening retirement community in Florida known as The Villages, Donald Trump promised to protect seniors from two of the most menacing monsters lurking under their beds: Immigrants and socialism.",oppose-medicare
"You would think it might get boring, blaming everything on foreigners and commies, but its political utility is tried and true.",oppose-medicare
"Signing an executive order—which did not mention immigrants at all—before the assembled, Trump promised that he “will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give it away to illegal aliens.” Democrats, he said, “want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism.” Into this category he placed both single-payer health care alongside the “so-called public option.” Nevermind the fact that the latter policy bears as much relation to socialism as Trump does to a rose petal.",oppose-medicare
"As hoary as the old-timey Red-baiting might seem, this executive order, and the rhetoric Trump deployed to promote it, is a distillation of his administration’s strategy to defeat the movement for single-payer.",oppose-medicare
"By pitting Americans against immigrants, and by telling seniors their Medicare would be under threat, Trump is banking on division and discord as a way to defeat a plan that would actually be beneficial for everyone except the very wealthiest.",oppose-medicare
"If Americans could realize the benefits of single-payer health care, and discover how different a life free from the worry of crippling health care debt could be, Republicans would not be able to persist in their promotion of the grim, race-to-the-bottom status quo.",oppose-medicare
"If this fight were fought on the merits and the facts, Trump would have no hope.",oppose-medicare
The executive order itself is a mish-mash of policy tweaks designed to further enhance the profitability of health care.,oppose-medicare
"Among the biggest winners are health insurers: The order instructs the Department of Health and Human Services to create rules promoting and expanding Medicare Advantage, the privatized part of Medicare under which insurers offer cheap plans that cover the benefits Medicare doesn’t.",oppose-medicare
"These ideas include encouraging “innovative [Medicare Advantage] benefit structures and plan designs”—“innovation” being the jollier term for privatization in the Trump era—and ensuring that the government doesn’t promote regular Medicare ahead of Medicare Advantage, which probably means directing the government to more fulsomely promote Medicare Advantage.",oppose-medicare
The Trump administration already bumped up reimbursement for Medicare Advantage plans by 3.4 percent in 2018.,oppose-medicare
Hospitals and health care providers would also win big.,oppose-medicare
"The order directs HHS to study raising the prices paid by Medicare “to more closely reflect the prices paid for services in [Medicare Advantage] and the commercial insurance market,” which reimburses providers at a far higher rate than Medicare does.",oppose-medicare
"The goal is, according to the order, to “encourage more robust price competition, and otherwise to inject market pricing” into Medicare fees.",oppose-medicare
It’s hardly worth noting the hypocrisy of a government that rails against the cost of socialized medicine proposing something that would cause government spending to skyrocket; this is the same bunch of crooks who pushed through a deficit-ballooning tax plan and claimed it would lower the deficit.,oppose-medicare
"This particular proposal would be great for hospitals and other health care providers, who would stand to reap greater profits.",oppose-medicare
It would be terrible for everyone else.,oppose-medicare
"This particular proposal would be great for hospitals and other health care providers, who would stand to reap greater profits.",oppose-medicare
It would be terrible for everyone else.,oppose-medicare
Medicare premiums would have to rise to cover these costs.,oppose-medicare
"There is no sense to raising provider rates to reflect what private insurance pays, because those rates are stupidly inflated and, for that matter, deeply opaque: The public does not know what private insurance pays.",oppose-medicare
"(Last month, the Cleveland Clinic argued in a regulatory comment that it simply could not disclose all the prices it charges to insurers, because there are more than 210 million of them.)",oppose-medicare
The market has not worked to constrain prices in the private market; it has sent them racing to unsustainable levels.,oppose-medicare
"Currently, about a third of Medicare enrollees are on Medicare Advantage.",oppose-medicare
"Premiums are very low, or sometimes even nothing, and the plans cover things beyond Medicare’s purview, such as dental and vision care, along with fancier benefits like gym memberships.",oppose-medicare
"It’s appealing in part because of the rough state in which Medicare exists, with no cap on out-of-pocket costs and no coverage for certain important medical needs.",oppose-medicare

"The plans use networks to restrict which doctors patients can see: One Kaiser Family Foundation study found that on average, Medicare Advantage plans included just 51 percent of hospitals in their county, and a separate study found the networks included only 46 percent of doctors in a county.",oppose-medicare
These plans also often have higher out-of-pocket costs.,oppose-medicare
"The average gross margin on Medicare Advantage plans is roughly double that of regular insurance, perhaps in part because the plans deny care that should be covered, and insurers overbill the government by billions each year.",oppose-medicare
"Growing Medicare Advantage is terrible policy, but it would be a smart strategy in the effort to crush single-payer.",oppose-medicare
"It’s akin to the dynamic in the private market for younger Americans: People with nice insurance subsidized by their employer will naturally want to guard that privilege, misguided as they are about how good that privilege really is.",oppose-medicare
"By growing the population with these prized Medicare Advantage plans, it grows the number of people with a plan that would be ended by single-payer—thus growing the audience for attacks centered on scary socialists Taking Away Your Plan.",oppose-medicare
"And by repeatedly telling seniors, whether they have Medicare Advantage or not, that single-payer supporters want to destroy their health care, Trump aims to rally a reliable voting bloc against their own self-interest.",oppose-medicare
"It’s a cruel joke that seniors, one of the groups of people who would be most helped by Medicare for All, are already the least interested in the idea and seem to be a primary target for the lies of single-payer opponents.",oppose-medicare
Many of the most prominent of these opponents are Democrats.,oppose-medicare
"In July, Joe Biden claimed incoherently at an AARP forum that under Medicare for All, “Medicare goes away as you know it.",oppose-medicare
All the Medicare you have is gone.,oppose-medicare
"It’s a new Medicare system.” A Joe Biden-linked polling firm was revealed last month to have tested messages opposing Medicare for All among Democrats, and found that one of the most effective attacks was claiming that it would lower the quality of care for senior citizens.",oppose-medicare
"And in February, Nancy Pelosi implied that Medicare under Medicare for All would be worse than the plans currently available under the Affordable Care Act, saying in a Rolling Stone interview:   When they say Medicare for All, people have to understand this: Medicare for All is not as good a benefit as the Affordable Care Act.",oppose-medicare

"And by the way, how’s it gonna be paid for?",oppose-medicare
"Either Nancy Pelosi was desperately uninformed about what one of the most prominent bills her caucus had introduced actually contains, or she was cravenly lying.",oppose-medicare
The same goes for Joe Biden.,oppose-medicare
"The fact is that Medicare for All would drastically improve Medicare for seniors, by eliminating almost all cost-sharing; by including free dental, hearing, and vision coverage; and by covering long-term care, which is currently only covered by Medicaid.",oppose-medicare
"Whether these lies are told by Trump, the health care industry, or Democrats, the intent is the same: Lie to seniors about what will happen to their Medicare and pit their interests against the interests of everyone else.",oppose-medicare

"It’s not just keeping the government’s hands off Medicare: It’s keeping your neighbors’ hands off it, too.",oppose-medicare
One of the groups that Trump believes the rest of America is most desperate to keep away from their Medicare are immigrants.,oppose-medicare
"Trump claimed that Democrats are proposing “draining your healthcare to finance the open borders,” and said Democrats “put foreign citizens who break our laws and endanger our country…way ahead of American citizens like you who obey our laws.” This is complete and utter dribble.",oppose-medicare

"(Trump also suggested that the pharmaceutical companies might be behind the push to impeach him, in retaliation for his desire to lower drug prices.)",oppose-medicare
"To be clear, immigrants pay far more into Medicare than they receive in benefits: A 2013 study published in Health Affairs found that immigrants “contributed $13.8 billion more to the [Hospital Insurance] Trust Fund than it paid out on their behalf,” largely because most of them are of working-age.",oppose-medicare

"It also effectively bans legal immigrants hoping to obtain visas from using the ACA subsidies that they otherwise qualify for, since those won’t count for the purposes of this rule.",oppose-medicare
"The order says the United States “admitting thousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs,” contributes to the problem of uncompensated care.",oppose-medicare

"(When my husband sponsored my green card, he had to sign a form promising to pay the government back if I ever used a means-tested benefit, like Medicaid.)",oppose-medicare

"A Politifact article from earlier this year did the painstaking and futile work of debunking a Facebook post, shared over 14,000 times, that wondered why “seniors on Social Security have to pay for Medicare and a supplemental (insurance) and the illegals get it all for free?” Since most Democratic candidates indicated their plans would cover undocumented immigrants—who need and deserve free health care as much as anyone else—it’s plausible that this particular attack has taken on new significance, though it’s also true that Republicans have been saying this since long before that debate stage moment.",oppose-medicare

"However, it was only that long ago that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) radically transformed the healthcare system in this country.Before Jan. 1, 2014, when the bulk of the ACA went into effect, Americans were completely at the mercy of an inequitable and unfair healthcare system: Insurers could place lifetime limits on covering essential benefits; drop your coverage if you got sick; or simply deny you coverage for “pre-existing” conditions.",oppose-medicare
"The ACA not only removed these outrageous barriers to getting health insurance, it gave all Americans, irrespective of provider, access to better quality and more affordable health insurance.",oppose-medicare

"Here are some of the biggest arguments against Bernie Sanders' 'Medicare for All' plan, which is gaining popularity among Democrats .",oppose-medicare
"Democrats are increasingly promoting an overhaul of US healthcare known as ""Medicare for All.""",oppose-medicare
"The idea, popularized by Sen. Bernie Sanders, would expand the government-run healthcare program to all Americans.",oppose-medicare
"Republicans have attacked the plans, including President Donald Trump.",oppose-medicare
Health policy experts have also identified key issues that any Medicare for All program would need to address.,oppose-medicare
"""Medicare for All,"" the idea to expand the government-run healthcare program to all Americans, is gaining steam among Democratic politicians and the party's base.",oppose-medicare
"Many candidates are taking on the issue as a central part of their 2018 midterm campaign, and serious contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination are also backing the idea.",oppose-medicare
But not everyone is a fan.,oppose-medicare
"Republicans, most notably President Donald Trump, have come out in recent weeks to bash the idea.",oppose-medicare
"While Trump's attacks leaned heavily on scare tactics, many conservative health policy analysts have also brought up a series of policy issues that could arise from the implementation of Medicare for All.",oppose-medicare
Conservatives and other opponents of the proposal raise a host of issues with the plan's cost and feasibility.,oppose-medicare
"The most cited objections:  Cost: What opponents are worried about: Sanders' own estimate totals the cost of his plan at $1.38 trillion a year, while other studies put it anywhere from $2.4 trillion to $2.8 trillion a year.",oppose-medicare
"A recent, well-publicized study by the Mercatus Center — a libertarian free-market think tank — put the price tag at $32.6 trillion over 10 years.",oppose-medicare
"What proponents counter: While the price tag for the federal government would rise, the benefits would far outweigh the costs.",oppose-medicare
"In particular, Sanders and others point to the Mercatus Center study's finding that National Health Expenditures — the total that households, businesses, and the government spend on healthcare — would actually be $2 trillion less than currently projected over the first 10 years after implementation.",oppose-medicare
"Reimbursement rates for healthcare providers: What opponents say: Sanders' plan assumes doctors, hospitals, and other providers will accept payment rates as much as 40% below what private insurance pays now.",oppose-medicare
"The idea is that since the government plan is the only game in town, healthcare providers will be forced to negotiate lower rates, which would drive down costs for the government.",oppose-medicare
But this could make some providers unprofitable and force some hospitals out of business.,oppose-medicare
"What proponents say: Providers will make up some of these lost payments in lower overhead costs, including less paperwork and fewer insurer disputes.",oppose-medicare
"Additionally, Medicare's reimbursements rates are higher than Medicaid's.",oppose-medicare
And more insured Americans would mean more consumers for hospitals.,oppose-medicare
Healthcare rationing and long wait times: What opponents say: The large influx of patients into the system and the lowered barrier to care could lead to long wait times and substandard care.,oppose-medicare
"Additionally, in many single-payer systems, the government can reject certain treatments as non cost-effective, which could limit options.",oppose-medicare
What proponents say: The US already rations care — people that don't have coverage often go without it or forego care that their plan may not cover.,oppose-medicare
"Additionally, many countries have longer wait times for elective surgery and non-emergency visits, but not for acute care.",oppose-medicare
These countries also have similar health outcomes and much lower costs.,oppose-medicare
Stifling pharmaceutical innovation: What opponents say: The US spends much more on drug development than other countries and part of the promised savings from the plan would come from negotiating lower drug prices.,oppose-medicare
"Since the government is the only buyer in the Medicare for All system, pharma companies would have little choice but accept the prices the government is willing to pay.",oppose-medicare
"In turn, opponents argue cutting the amount of money the government pays out for the products pharma and medical device companies make could stifle their research and development.",oppose-medicare
What proponents say: Many pharmaceutical and medical device breakthroughs already use public funds and many innovations are still developed outside of the US.,oppose-medicare
"Additionally, most pharma companies already spend much more on marketing, which would become less important in a single-payer system.",oppose-medicare
"Why ‘Medicare-For-All’ Is Not The Answer The Affordable Care Act survived the Supreme Court and a presidential election, so why does it face such an uncertain future?",oppose-medicare
One reason is that it was essentially silent on how to control costs.,oppose-medicare
This has led many pundits – including the likes of Paul Krugman and Robert Reich – to argue that the best approach would be to extend Medicare to everyone.,oppose-medicare
"A January National Research Council report on the relative disadvantage of America in global health outcomes, especially compared to countries with national health insurance, added further fuel to the fire.",oppose-medicare
But is a larger government role in health insurance the best approach?,oppose-medicare
The idea of universal Medicare is powerful and attractive.,oppose-medicare
"Mr. Krugman points out that in the last forty years, average Medicare costs per person have grown by 400 percent while those for private insurance have increased more than 700 percent.",oppose-medicare
"His numbers suggest that if everyone had Medicare for the last 40 years, we might now spend only 14 percent of GDP on health care instead of nearly 18 percent, while also reaching universal coverage.",oppose-medicare
"Mr. Reich argues that “Medicare-for-All” would save between $58 billion and $400 billion annually, and similarly concludes: “Medicare isn’t the problem.",oppose-medicare
"It’s the solution.” Critics of the U.S. system are also quick to point out that Americans don’t live as long as their counterparts in countries that spend much less, suggesting universal Medicare could save money and improve our health.",oppose-medicare
The argument for universal Medicare basically comes down to three key claims:  (1) Medicare gets lower prices; (2) Medicare’s administrative costs are lower; and (3) greater spending does not mean better health.,oppose-medicare
Each of these deserves closer attention.,oppose-medicare
Consider first the argument that Medicare has lower prices.,oppose-medicare
"This happens because the government, as the largest purchaser of health care, can demand lower payments for services compared to private insurers.",oppose-medicare
"In fact, because Medicare is the only payer for people aged 65 and older, it can quote take-it-or-leave-it prices, and choosing to leave it means providers can’t treat 40 million of the sickest Americans.",oppose-medicare
"That is a lot of market power; indeed, economists have a word for it: monopsony.",oppose-medicare
"The classic problem of monopsony buying power, however, is underprovision of services.",oppose-medicare
The medical market is no exception.,oppose-medicare
"This problem manifested in Medicaid years ago – as states started to clamp down on payments, providers exited the market, leaving us with the patchwork system we have today.",oppose-medicare
Could the same happen to Medicare?,oppose-medicare
We are already hearing reports of doctors who do not take Medicare patients.,oppose-medicare
"In a 2010 survey of 9,000 physicians, the American Medical Association reported that 17 percent of doctors restricted the number of Medicare patients; among primary care physicians, a whopping 31 percent did.",oppose-medicare
"With universal Medicare, is the population really going to accept, and would Congress really allow, the continued reductions in prices?",oppose-medicare
Administrative costs.,oppose-medicare
Proponents of universal Medicare often point to the much higher administrative costs in private plans.,oppose-medicare
But are such higher administrative costs necessarily bad?,oppose-medicare
"For one, the large variation in Medicare costs suggests inefficiencies that might be corrected through more administrative spending.",oppose-medicare
"Over the last 40 years, the Dartmouth group has documented extensive geographic variation in Medicare spending that is unexplained by demographics, income, or disease severity.",oppose-medicare
Areas with 30 percent higher spending seem to have no better outcomes.,oppose-medicare
"Ironically, Medicare's low administrative costs – about 3 percent compared with 17 percent in the private sector – may be to blame for the high spending.",oppose-medicare
The private sector uses these funds to do a better job controlling excessive use.,oppose-medicare
Tomas Philipson and colleagues have shown that the variation in Medicare hospital use is four times larger than the private sector when it comes to heart disease.,oppose-medicare
"Because it can rely on its monopsony power to control overall spending, Medicare has a weaker incentive to limit overuse.",oppose-medicare
"Meanwhile private insurers have become more efficient, employing tools such as utilization review and case management (which count as administrative costs) to assess patient needs and then either restrict services or steer patients towards more cost-effective care.",oppose-medicare
"In a world without private insurance, we would likely see more money wasted on care that produces no benefit for patients.",oppose-medicare
"In addition, administrative spending protects against fraud.",oppose-medicare
"By some estimates, the Medicare program loses a staggering $60 billion to fraud each year.",oppose-medicare
This amounts to 11 percent of the Medicare budget and would be enough to double Federal spending on primary and secondary education.,oppose-medicare
No private company would ever tolerate this abuse.,oppose-medicare
Imagine the fraud if Medicare covered 300 million Americans.,oppose-medicare
International comparisons and spending.,oppose-medicare
"Finally, it’s time we made sense of international comparisons, since they are often used to assail the current health care system.",oppose-medicare
"Despite spending more than any other nation per capita on health care, American life expectancy at birth ranks 34th worldwide.",oppose-medicare
"Several countries ranked ahead of the U.S., including Canada and England – have single payer health systems, raising the question of whether replacing private insurance with universal Medicare would make us healthier.",oppose-medicare
"But, as the NRC points out, these comparisons conflate health care with numerous other influences.",oppose-medicare
"What we eat, the stress in our lives, exercise, the air we breathe, our genes, and a host of other personal and environmental factors determine our health.",oppose-medicare
Take obesity for example.,oppose-medicare
"Much of American’s low life expectancy stems from obesity, but the primary causes of American obesity are not health care.",oppose-medicare
"Steven Woolf, the Chairman of a recent study on life expectancy by the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine concluded, “Much of our health disadvantage comes from factors outside of the clinical system and outside of what doctors and hospitals can do.”  Once we get a disease, there are certainly places where higher U.S. spending buys better care.",oppose-medicare
Cancer is a poignant example.,oppose-medicare
"The largest study to date of global comparisons in cancer survival finds the U.S. ranks first or within the top three for the three cancers analyzed: breast, prostate, and colorectal.",oppose-medicare
"The magnitude of the differences between countries is also large; an American diagnosed with prostate cancer has a 91 percent chance of surviving at least five years, but the odds drop to fifty-fifty if you live in England.",oppose-medicare
"Or take breast cancer, where the 5-year survival rate is 83 percent in the U.S. compared to 69 percent in England.",oppose-medicare
"In Canada, where financing is public but provision is private, the differences are narrower but the higher U.S. survival rates remain statistically significant.",oppose-medicare
Improved survival in the U.S. does not appear to be driven by Medicare.,oppose-medicare
Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) project reveals survival rates are higher for groups under age 65 than over 65 and cancer prevalence is only slightly higher among the older group.,oppose-medicare
"While lead-time bias is a possibility, better U.S. cancer survival suggests our largely private insurance system delivers value in treating (if not preventing) certain diseases.",oppose-medicare
"Cancer is only one example, but it’s an important one.",oppose-medicare
All this is not to say that private insurance is perfect.,oppose-medicare
"Problems of adverse selection, care coordination, and complexity exist.",oppose-medicare
Waste is still an issue.,oppose-medicare
"However, the argument that Medicare is superior in terms of cost savings and quality is flawed and ignores key factors that make any conclusion decidedly more nuanced.",oppose-medicare
"As the country’s fiscal challenges pressure us to make dramatic health system changes, we should be wary of calls to implement “Medicare-for-All.”",oppose-medicare
10 Reasons Medicare-For-All Is A Bad Idea Besides Financial Bankruptcy.,oppose-medicare
"Former vice president Joe Biden distinguished himself from other candidates in the most recent Democratic presidential debate by opposing Medicare-for-All, mainly by expressing concerns about cost.",oppose-medicare
"In doing so, Biden echoed Republicans’ favorite argument against single-payer health care: “How will they pay for it?”  Still, Republicans and Joe Biden are making a huge mistake by focusing on cost.",oppose-medicare
The implication is that government-run health care would be a good thing—a wonderful thing!—if only we could afford it.,oppose-medicare
"The important reality is that (in addition to runaway costs that would necessitate higher taxes, even on middle-income people) Medicare for All stinks for many other reasons.",oppose-medicare
Here are just ten.,oppose-medicare
Ruinous to Health-Care Quality  Medicare for All will hurt the quality of health care in America.,oppose-medicare
Sen. Bernie Sanders and other M4A advocates rely on misleading international comparisons that make the quality of U.S. health care look bad.,oppose-medicare
"In reality, Americans have access to world-class health care, especially the Americans with private insurance.",oppose-medicare
But we can kiss that goodbye under M4A.,oppose-medicare
Medicare For All Will Not Help the Uninsured Medicare for All will not help the uninsured.,oppose-medicare
"Just remember, the last expansion of government health insurance was the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid, the program for low-income people.",oppose-medicare
"As a study in the New England Journal of Medicine said, “Medicaid coverage generated no significant improvements [compared to being uninsured] in measured physical health outcomes in the first two years.”  3.",oppose-medicare
It Will Make Wait Times Worse Medicare for All will make wait times for care longer.,oppose-medicare
"In other countries with socialized medical systems, patients must wait longer, on average, to see doctors and get procedures than Americans do.",oppose-medicare
"After four weeks, 70 percent of Americans have seen a specialist, while only 40 percent of Canadians have.",oppose-medicare
M4A Will Swamp Emergency Rooms Medicare for All will swamp emergency rooms.,oppose-medicare
"Probably because they can’t get timely doctor appointments, Canadians use hospital emergency departments much more than Americans do—and even there, they wait longer, according to the Commonwealth Fund.",oppose-medicare
"It Will End Private Health Insurance  Medicare for All will end private insurance options, including employer-provided insurance plans.",oppose-medicare
"It says it right there in the name: Medicare “for All.” As Larry Levitt, a health policy expert at the left-leaning Kaiser Family Foundation, has said, “As a practical matter, Senator Sanders’ Medicare for all bill would mean the end of private health insurance.",oppose-medicare
"Employer health benefits would no longer exist, and private insurance would be prohibited from duplicating the coverage under Medicare.”  6.",oppose-medicare
It Will Rob the Neediest People Medicare for All will stretch Medicare and rob resources from those who truly need a safety net.,oppose-medicare
"Today the United States has health-care safety-net programs for veterans, seniors, and low-income people, particularly low-income pregnant women, children, and people with disabilities.",oppose-medicare
Opening these programs to everyone would make it harder for vulnerable patients to see doctors.,oppose-medicare
"One-fifth of doctors already turn away new Medicare patients, and it’s even worse in Medicaid, Centers for Disease Control data show.",oppose-medicare
Medicare For All Will Reduce Medical Innovation Medicare for All will reduce medical innovation.,oppose-medicare
"CMS Administrator Seema Verma calls M4A “the greatest threat to innovation in health care” probably because she’s seen how Medicare, with all its good intentions, has slowed medical innovations that could have helped the elderly.",oppose-medicare
It Will Worsen the Culture War Medicare for All will worsen the culture war.,oppose-medicare
"If you like political debates about birth control, abortion, physician-assisted suicide, vaccines, or transgender surgery, you’re going to love Medicare for All!",oppose-medicare
Gets Government Up In Your Grill  Medicare for All will insert government into other personal choices.,oppose-medicare
Even what we eat becomes government’s business as soon as taxpayers are primarily responsible for our health-care bills.,oppose-medicare
(Remember the “Broccoli Mandate?”) And that’s not all.,oppose-medicare
"Just Google “Social Determinants of Health” to learn how health care is really the bridge by which government could control, well, anything.",oppose-medicare
M4A Actually Devalues Lives Medicare for All will devalue lives that aren’t useful to the government.,oppose-medicare
"While it seems unthinkable that a society would put able-bodied workers (read: taxpayers) ahead of children and the elderly (budget liabilities), this is the incentive that socialized medicine creates.",oppose-medicare
"Just as water flows downhill, bad incentives eventually erode government policy to serve… government.",oppose-medicare
"Of course, policymakers should continue to talk about how expensive Medicare for All is.",oppose-medicare
A $32-trillion price tag is concerning.,oppose-medicare
"But they should take care to emphasize that, even if we had the tax dollars necessary to fund it, those dollars aren’t the greatest cost of socialized medicine.",oppose-medicare
Why Medicare-for-All Is Not Good for America SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS recently announced his Medicare-for-All bill.,oppose-medicare
This is basically the senate version of the congressional bill introduced by Pramila Jayapal.,oppose-medicare
The bill would eliminate the insurance industry and much of the billing bureaucracy that exists today.,oppose-medicare
It would provide health care coverage for everyone and eliminate copays and deductibles.,oppose-medicare
"It would expand Medicare coverage to include dental, vision and long-term nursing home care.",oppose-medicare
There are many questions about how this approach to universal care would be funded.,oppose-medicare
"No budget has been provided, though estimates vary from an annual increase in cost of $3.2 trillion to an annual savings of $600 billion.",oppose-medicare
"Jayapal said it would likely require raising taxes on the wealthy, and Sanders suggested this could be up to 70%.",oppose-medicare
Another option could be taxing investment income at the same rate as stock sales.,oppose-medicare
"Under the Medicare-for-All plan, private insurance would be eliminated and physicians who are in private practice would be paid on a fee-for-service basis through a national fee schedule, likely at the current Medicare rate or slightly lower.",oppose-medicare
"By eliminating the insurance industry, the plan would also eliminate one million jobs.",oppose-medicare
"The new fee schedule would be significantly lower than the current industry fee schedule, which means Medicare-for-All would likely lower physician incomes in a significant way, making a bad situation for physicians even worse.",oppose-medicare
There are three basic objections to Medicare-for-All.,oppose-medicare
"The first is that taxes would go up, so it would not receive bipartisan support.",oppose-medicare
The second is that it's a vote loser.,oppose-medicare
"When Americans are polled, 70% say that they approve of Medicare-for-All.",oppose-medicare
"However, when a follow-up question is asked, in which it is made clear that this means everybody would be required to have it, support drops to 38%.",oppose-medicare
"The third and perhaps most important objection is that many experienced doctors would simply leave the profession, and this problem is not solved by retaining the commercial insurance corporations, since this is merely retaining a system that needs to change.",oppose-medicare
"Physicians are the single most important service provider in any healthcare system, and we are facing a shortage.",oppose-medicare
"The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that this shortage will worsen, even without the negative influence of Medicare-for-All.",oppose-medicare
"And doctors face the highest burnout rate among all professions -- as many as 46% of doctors in the U.S. have suffered from burnout at some time in their careers, according to Dr. Dike Drummond in his article from Family Practice Management Journal.",oppose-medicare
"In our book, ""Healing American Healthcare,"" we describe our Eichhorn-Hutchinson plan.",oppose-medicare
"There are six critical objectives that, if achieved, could improve quality while reducing the cost of healthcare by as much $1 trillion per year:   Medicare for How Many?",oppose-medicare
Provide universal health care by requiring all employers to provide health insurance for their employees.,oppose-medicare
"Establish and provide a national health care option, which we have named Allcare, which would provide the same minimum benefits of the Medicare program.",oppose-medicare
We estimate that the cost of Allcare would be 30% below the average cost of employer-based health insurance today as established by the annual Kaiser Family Foundation Survey.,oppose-medicare
"Existing insurers would be invited to compete, and could develop Medicare Advantage-like plans to expand benefit offerings to people under the age of 65.",oppose-medicare
Control drug costs through the establishment of a national negotiating platform that would be shared with all health care systems to prevent and eliminate price gouging in the pharmaceutical industry and unreasonable hospital markups of drugs they administer to their patients.,oppose-medicare
The goal is to reduce the per capita costs of our medications to match the per capita cost of other industrialized democracies.,oppose-medicare
Nonprofit hospitals and nonprofit hospital systems that earn operating profits would be required to pay income tax at the corporate rate.,oppose-medicare
Reduce the complexity and bureaucracy of billing by having a national standard for the cost of care: a national chargemaster for all services provided for patients at any hospital or clinic or doctor's office anywhere in the US regardless of the provider's tax status as for-profit or nonprofit entities.,oppose-medicare
Eliminate hospital facility fees for outpatient testing and standardize all imaging and lab testing fees.,oppose-medicare
"While this would be a loss of revenue for hospitals, at the same time hospitals would gain by not having to provide indigent care, since everyone would be insured, and by shedding much of their bureaucratic overhead.",oppose-medicare
"Use the health care data that is available to monitor costs, improve quality, and reduce waste, and recommend that Accountable Care Organizations be provided with this data as they work to control costs and improve patient outcomes.",oppose-medicare
"Massively reduce the complexity of the Electronic Health Record, or EHR, and EHR-associated measures of efficiency and quality, which are burdensome, insulting and actually reduce efficiency and quality.",oppose-medicare
The EHR is the number one cause of physician burnout – let's let doctors go back to being doctors.,oppose-medicare
We also believe that employers and individuals should have choice in selecting health insurance.,oppose-medicare
"Under our plan, employers could be self-insured, contract with private insurance companies or contract with Allcare.",oppose-medicare
"In each case they could have Gold, Silver or Bronze plans to expand physician networks for their employees.",oppose-medicare
"This layered plan would allow anyone to be insured at the level of basic Medicare, but by paying extra would gain access to larger pools of doctors.",oppose-medicare
Individuals could also choose between Allcare and private insurance.,oppose-medicare
"Our proposed plan reduces bureaucracy and medical waste, while improving quality and creating much-needed competition.",oppose-medicare
Savings to corporations alone would be as much as $174 billion annually.,oppose-medicare
"Today, 15 million Medicaid beneficiaries are employed.",oppose-medicare
"Under our plan, they and their families would receive health insurance through their employers.",oppose-medicare
This would reduce the cost of the Medicaid program by 31%.,oppose-medicare
We believe that our plan provides an opportunity for legislative compromise.,oppose-medicare
Both liberal and moderate Democrats want a universal health care system that covers all Americans.,oppose-medicare
They would like a single-payer system like Medicare-for-All or a combination of public and private payers that would cover everyone.,oppose-medicare
"Historically Republicans would like to reduce the federal deficit, and it is likely that they feel a more urgent need to do so with the passage of the tax cut of 2018 that is projected to increase the deficit.",oppose-medicare
Efforts to reduce the federal deficit will likely in part focus on expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid.,oppose-medicare
They also want to give people more choice in health care.,oppose-medicare
All of these goals could be accomplished with the adoption of the Eichhorn Hutchinson Health Care Plan.,oppose-medicare
"The #1 Reason Elizabeth Warren’s Medicare-for-All Plan Is A Singularly Bad Idea  TLDR: even using the rosy assumptions of Senator Warren’s health plan advisors, her plan would increase deadweight losses by $7.7 trillion in its first 10 years (39% of the new federal taxes needed).",oppose-medicare
"Using the most plausible spending and revenue assumptions, her health plan would create deadweight losses of $8.7 trillion.",oppose-medicare
"Two years ago, I penned a five-part series explaining why Senator Bernie Sanders' single-payer health plan (Medicare-for-All) was a singularly bad idea.",oppose-medicare
"Sadly, this misguided policy prescription has not gone away.",oppose-medicare
"Senator Elizabeth Warren has not only endorsed the plan: by tweaking its cost containment provisions and being more transparent about its financing, she has managed to make the plan even worse and more devastating than the Sanders plan in terms of the hidden costs it will impose on all Americans.",oppose-medicare
"As of November 24, RealClearPolitics betting odds now show Senator Warren neck-in-neck with Vice President Joe Biden (25.3 vs. 25.6) but far ahead of Senator Sanders (15.9).",oppose-medicare
That admittedly is a sharp decline from her peak of 53.4 in mid-October and it would appear that the rollout of her health plan has been an important factor in that sharp reversal of fortune.,oppose-medicare
"While we are far from the 2020 Democratic Convention and anything can happen, at this juncture it certainly does not appear implausible that Senator Warren will end up being her party’s standard-bearer next November.",oppose-medicare
Given that Senator Warren has merely proposed a delay of up to three years in the implementation of her plan—as opposed to deep-sixing it altogether.,oppose-medicare
I thought it would be useful to update my earlier assessment and remind readers of the top 5 reasons her single-payer is a singularly bad idea.,oppose-medicare
"Today's post will focus on the most important reason, albeit the one least understood by the average policymaker or member of the public.",oppose-medicare
"In economic jargon, that reason is termed the ""excess burden"" of taxes, more popularly known as ""deadweight losses.""",oppose-medicare
"Today In: Business This may sound complicated, but it's actually quite simple.",oppose-medicare
"With one exception, every tax known to man shrinks the economy to some extent resulting in a loss of welfare for consumers and producers [1].",oppose-medicare
"That is, “whatever you tax, you get less of,” whether that be labor, consumption of various products, capital or anything else policymakers have figured out how to tax.",oppose-medicare
The exact amount the economy shrinks (which in turn determines the size of the associated welfare losses to consumers and producers) depends upon exactly what is taxed.,oppose-medicare
"For interested readers, the parallel assessment of deadweight losses under the Sanders plan is here.",oppose-medicare
"But keep in mind that the earlier assessment was focused on the impact in just 2016, whereas in this series I am summarizing the 10-year impact from 2020-2029.",oppose-medicare
Will Medicare-for-All Increase or Decrease Health Spending?,oppose-medicare
"To figure out the magnitude of deadweight losses Warren’s plan will impose, we first have to figure out what it will do to health spending and the size of the hole that has to be filled by new federal tax revenues.",oppose-medicare
"As you can see, there’s a variety of cost estimates for Medicare-for-All that vary all over the map in terms of their projected impact on health spending [2].",oppose-medicare
The most enthusiastic proponents of single-payer—shown (fittingly) on the far left—believe it has the potential to reduce American health spending by anywhere from one-eighth to about one quarter.,oppose-medicare
Warren’s purported new and improved version would cut spending only a smidgeon.,oppose-medicare
"But Avik Roy, (who runs The Apothecary blog and also serves as the Forbes policy editor) has developed a much more realistic score.",oppose-medicare
"He has shown that once you look behind all the smoke and mirrors and plug in more plausible assumptions about spending and potential savings, Senator Warren’s plan could end up increasing health spending by 13.6% in its first 10 years.",oppose-medicare
Will Medicare-for-All Increase or Decrease Health Spending?,oppose-medicare
There is a similar diversity of opinion about how much Medicare-for-All would increase federal spending on on health care.,oppose-medicare
"To standardize these estimates and make them comparable, I have expressed this increase as a fraction of National Health Expenditures.",oppose-medicare
"In 2020, NHE is expected to be about $3.5 trillion dollars [Table 3].",oppose-medicare
So an increase in federal spending equal to 40% predicted by Friedman implies that federal spending on health care would be $1.4 trillion higher than it is today [3].,oppose-medicare
"Given that the federal government is expected to spend $1.3 trillion next year under the status quo, this increase implies more than a doubling of federal dollars used to pay for health care (thus care should be taken not to misinterpret the percentages in Fig.",oppose-medicare
2 as representing percentage increases in federal spending.,oppose-medicare
"Because the time periods covered by these various studies vary, it was easier to standardize all estimates using the aggregate amount of NHE—which again varied by study because of differing time frames and assumptions—as the denominator).",oppose-medicare
"As you can see, by under-estimating the amount of new health spending likely to occur and by being overly optimistic about non-federal sources of revenue, Warren Plan advisors have calculated an increase in federal spending that is lower than every other estimate out there except one.",oppose-medicare
"In contrast, Avik Roy has shown that once these unrealistic assumptions are stripped away, the increase in federal spending needed to bankroll Warren’s health plan would rise to 65% of NHE, implying far high taxes and deadweight losses than if we relied on the rosy assumptions of the Warren plan.",oppose-medicare
"While I do not agree with every detail of his analysis, we each conclude that under the Warren plan federal spending would increase by nearly the same amount ($27.7 trillion vs. his estimate of $27.2 trillion) over its first ten years [4].",oppose-medicare
How Big Are the Deadweight Losses from Taxation?,oppose-medicare
So now we finally can examine the magnitude of hidden deadweight losses that Senator Warren’s health plan would create.,oppose-medicare
Deadweight losses are the #1 reason single-payer is a bad idea simply because of their sheer size.,oppose-medicare
As you can see in Fig.,oppose-medicare
"3, the exact amount the economy shrinks (which in turn determines the size of the associated deadweight losses) depends upon exactly what is taxed.",oppose-medicare
Such losses are typically expressed as a fraction of revenue raised.,oppose-medicare
"The excess burden does not include the entire dollar amount that the economy shrinks as a consequence of a tax, but simply the consumer and producer surpluses associated with that lost output.",oppose-medicare
The average excess burden represents the entire amount of such losses as a fraction of the entire amount of tax revenue raised.,oppose-medicare
"But it is well established the excess burdens rise with the square of the tax rate: thus the excess burden associated with increasing income taxes from 35% to 40% is much larger than increasing them from 10% to 15%, for example.",oppose-medicare
"Since we already have an established tax system and rates that raise trillions of dollars a year, what matters for policy purposes is the marginal excess burden associated with the tax increases that would be needed on top of what we already collect.",oppose-medicare
"I have estimated that at the margin, deadweight losses for the federal tax system amount to 26 cents for every dollar of revenue raised [5].",oppose-medicare
"That means that if Senator Warren plans to finance the entire $4.2 trillion American health economy in 2020 [Table 3] using federal taxes, we'd have to be prepared to accept welfare losses amounting to $1.1 trillion that year!",oppose-medicare
That certainly should at least give pause to anyone who thinks letting Uncle Sam bankroll all health spending is good idea.,oppose-medicare
"As I noted earlier, the actual degree to which the economy would shrink depends heavily on how Senator Warren plans to bankroll what would constitute by far the biggest free lunch in American history (easily dwarfing Medicare, Medicaid or even Social Security in terms of annual spending).",oppose-medicare
"Sadly, Senator Warren’s preoccupation with fairness has trumped common sense as she has proposed a series of new taxes that almost appear to designed to maximize rather than minimized deadweight losses.",oppose-medicare
Skeptics need not rely on my own (literature-based) estimates of the size of these excess burdens.,oppose-medicare
"To account for these excess burdens in cost-benefit analyses, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget for the last quarter century has required federal agencies to assign a shadow cost of 25 cents to each dollar of expenditures financed out of tax revenues (Circular A-94: p. 13).",oppose-medicare
"More recently, the 2019 Economic Report of the President uses a marginal excess burden figure of 50% to score Medicare for All plans.",oppose-medicare
"So whether the figure is 25%, 26% or 50%, it is far too high to simply ignore in discussions about the merits of single-payer health care.",oppose-medicare
Can Deadweight Losses be Avoided?,oppose-medicare
"There are only two ways to avoid deadweight losses:  The first is a uniform head tax (even economists are not cynical enough to believe people would commit suicide to avoid such a tax) But it is ludicrous to expect progressives to support an additional annual tax on all Americans of $11,500 per person (!",oppose-medicare
"), which is the amount that would be required in 2020 [6].",oppose-medicare
"The second is a tax on land, but the amount needed for Medicare for All would dwarf the amounts now collected by states and local governments [7].",oppose-medicare
"Of course, precisely because of deadweight losses, it is lunacy for us to be bankrolling Medicare expenses for people such as Warren Buffett and his wife.",oppose-medicare
"Such a couple in the same income bracket as Warren Buffett but who turned 65 in 2015 would be expected to collect $427,000 in lifetime Medicare benefits despite having paid only $111,000 in lifetime taxes into Medicare.",oppose-medicare
"So the net amount financed by taxes for such a couple is $316,000.",oppose-medicare
This is transparently indefensible on equity grounds since this couple could easily afford to pay for their own post-retirement health expenses.,oppose-medicare
"but it also implies that we're willing to accept $82,000 in deadweight losses simply for the privilege of saying that the wealthiest among us has the same Medicare card as everyone else.",oppose-medicare
How crazy is that?,oppose-medicare
"From where I sit, we would be much better off restricting the use of tax dollars to finance a safety net for the poor rather than any sort of universal entitlement (including Medicare).",oppose-medicare
"Consider Switzerland, which provides universal coverage, but restricts government subsidies only to families who would otherwise spend more than 10% of family income paying for mandatory health insurance.",oppose-medicare
The consequence is that the Swiss government pays for only 31% of health spending (compared to about 65% in the U.S.).,oppose-medicare
How Large Would the Deadweight Losses Be Under Medicare-for-All?,oppose-medicare
"I calculated total deadweight losses two ways: first using all the assumptions of Warren health plan advisors regarding health spending, savings and the estimated amount of new federal revenue required between 2020-2029 and then using assumptions I view as more plausible [8].",oppose-medicare
I then applied various MEB estimates from the literature to each of the revenue sources proposed by Warren health plan advisors [9].,oppose-medicare
"All told, even if we score it using the highly unrealistic assumptions of her advisors, Senator Warren's Medicare-for-All plan would have a hidden cost of $3.3 trillion to $15.4 trillion in deadweight losses over its first decade, the most likely estimate being $7.7 trillion.",oppose-medicare
"By way of comparison, this year’s GDP $21.4 trillion.",oppose-medicare
So the damage that Senator Warren’s health plan will do in its first 10 years is the rough equivalent of sacrificing one third of our economy for an entire year.,oppose-medicare
"In its first year alone, her plan would impose hidden costs of at least $1,900 for each U.S. resident or in excess of $7,800 for every family of 4 [9].",oppose-medicare
"Interestingly, the deadweight losses are not that much higher when more realistic spending and revenue assumptions are plugged in.",oppose-medicare
"Even though they are calculated on new federal tax revenues that are $10 trillion more than the official Warren plan figures, deadweight losses only rise by $1 trillion.",oppose-medicare
"There is a straightforward explanation for this puzzle: I have assumed that revenues from the most punishing taxes proposed by Senator Warren (e.g., the wealth tax) have been replaced by federal taxes whose deadweight losses average only 26% of revenue.",oppose-medicare
"Along similar lines, I have assumed that the $15.1 trillion in additional taxes that the Warren plan requires likewise would generate an excess burden of 26% rather than the 39% weighted-average DWL burden that would result if the Warren plan were able to raise taxes in the amounts envisioned by Senator Warren’s advisors.",oppose-medicare
"Bottom Line  Remember how President Obama promised his health plan would save the typical family of 4 $2,500 a year?",oppose-medicare
His plan barely squeaked by on a party-line vote.,oppose-medicare
Are Americans really prepared to get behind a single-payer plan that would impose deadweight losses that might be more than 3 times as large as those mythical Obamacare savings?,oppose-medicare
"I do not doubt that among the most fervent single-payer advocates, $3.3 to $15.4 trillion over 10 years is merely a worthwhile price to pay for the communitarian benefit of putting all Americans on a completely equal footing when it comes to paying for health care.",oppose-medicare
"But I am guessing that if the average American were well-informed about this unavoidable cost of Senator Warren’s plan, public support for her single-payer health care would sink even faster than it already has.",oppose-medicare
Spread the word...,oppose-medicare
"Jobs Disappear Under Medicare-For-All Election campaigns vet candidates, but they also vet ideas.",oppose-medicare
"In the case of Medicare-for-all, it is hard to think of an idea that one or more major candidates have advanced in a primary that has fared worse.",oppose-medicare
"And the more facts that come in, the worse it fares.",oppose-medicare
"Politico reported recently:  Initial research from University of Massachusetts economists who have consulted with multiple 2020 campaigns has estimated that 1.8 million health care jobs nationwide would no longer be needed if Medicare-for-all became law, upending health insurance companies and thousands of middle class workers whose jobs largely deal with them, including insurance brokers, medical billing workers and other administrative employees.",oppose-medicare
One widely cited study published in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated that administration accounted for nearly a third of the U.S.’ health care expenses.,oppose-medicare
"It seems that “health care workers are interwoven throughout the economy, employed by large institutions like hospitals, health insurance companies and nursing homes but also in places like small accounting firms that help clinicians get reimbursed for care, and as independent brokers who help sell insurance products to customers.”  This does not even account for job losses among medical providers (e.g., doctors, nurses, technicians) who will be squeezed by reimbursement rates lower than what private health insurance has provided.",oppose-medicare
"Seizing on this news, Joe Biden’s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield put out a written statement wthat read, in part: “The Medicare-for-all plans that Senators Warren and Sanders are proposing will not only cost 160 million Americans their private health coverage and force tax increases on the middle class, but it would also kill almost 2 million jobs — and that’s according to one of Sen. Warren’s own policy advisers.” Moving to the heart of the electability issue, Bedingfield argues, “Simply put, we’re not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care.",oppose-medicare
"And we’re certainly not going to beat him by trying to kill millions of jobs in communities around our country.”  Warren’s cavalier response to the issue, namely that health-insurance workers would find invisible jobs in other insurance industries, is nonsensical.",oppose-medicare
It is ironic that Warren and others would enact all sorts of trade protections to insulate American workers from disruption but think nothing of enacting their own plans that would be equally if not more painful for American workers.,oppose-medicare
"This is what comes of thinking of problems as Bad Guys (e.g., Big Insurance Companies, Big Pharma) vs. Good Guys.",oppose-medicare
"In fact “Bad Guys” employ millions of ordinary Americans and help maintain, for example, some rural hospitals that could not survive on government reimbursement rates.",oppose-medicare
Those hospitals in turn provide the backbone of the economy in small towns and rural communities throughout the country.,oppose-medicare
Health care (both insurance and its delivery system) is complicated and expensive.,oppose-medicare
Dramatic changes will have dramatic unintended consequences.,oppose-medicare
That is not an excuse for doing nothing.,oppose-medicare
"It is, however, a powerful argument for building on what works, not frightening millions of Americans, and proceeding with caution and humility.",oppose-medicare
Moderates would be wise to apply this lesson beyond health care to a range of issues.,oppose-medicare
Sometimes less really is more.,oppose-medicare
Why ‘Medicare for All’ Would Be Bad News for Everyone .,oppose-medicare
"Polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Harvard School of Public Health with Politico show a majority of Americans favor “Medicare for All” proposals at least in concept, which is simple enough: a single, government-controlled health insurance program that would cover every person residing in the United States.",oppose-medicare
The Harvard-Politico poll found that 68 percent of respondents say that adopting a national health plan like “Medicare for All” should be an “extremely important” priority for the new Congress.,oppose-medicare
"The Kaiser Family Foundation reports that 56 percent of Americans favor the proposal, and just 42 percent oppose it.",oppose-medicare
But do Americans really understand what such a project would entail?,oppose-medicare
"Based on the available survey evidence, the answer is no.",oppose-medicare
"For example, the Kaiser survey found that 55 percent of respondents erroneously think that they would be able to keep their current health insurance.",oppose-medicare
Only 35 percent realize (correctly) that they would lose it.,oppose-medicare
"In these trying times, we must turn to the greatest document in the history of the world to promise freedom and opportunity to its citizens for guidance.",oppose-medicare
"Find out more now >>  Likewise, a national survey conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago found that 55 percent of respondents think (incorrectly) that participation in such a plan would be voluntary.",oppose-medicare
"In fact, any American can easily learn “what’s in” the leading “Medicare for All” proposals.",oppose-medicare
The legislative language of the leading Democratic bills (H.R.,oppose-medicare
676 and S. 1804) is clear.,oppose-medicare
The House bill prohibits any private health insurer from offering any of the 10 statutorily designated categories of health benefits or specialized services authorized by Congress.,oppose-medicare
"According to Title I, Section 104 of the House bill, “It is unlawful for a private health insurer to sell health coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act.”  The House bill, in other words, would prohibit ordinary Americans from purchasing any alternative health coverage, except for items such as “cosmetic surgery” or health services that government officials decide are not “medically necessary.”  Not surprisingly, the Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that if the “Medicare for All” plan would “eliminate private insurance companies,” respondents would oppose it by a margin of 58 to 37 percent.",oppose-medicare
"The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also prohibits any private health plan that “duplicates” the benefit coverage of the government’s national health insurance program.",oppose-medicare
"Under Section 801, the bill outlaws employer-sponsored health insurance: “No employee benefit plan may provide benefits that duplicate payment for any items or services for which payment may be made under the Medicare for All Act of 2017.”  Ironically, the House and Senate “Medicare for All” bills abolish Medicare.",oppose-medicare
"Yet the Kaiser Family Foundation survey finds that a majority of Americans would oppose the “Medicare for All” plan by a margin of 60 to 32 percent if it “threatens the current Medicare program.”  The House and Senate bills would also abolish Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and Obamacare health plans.",oppose-medicare
"Under Section 212 of the House bill, federal funds are to be “transferred and appropriated” from the Treasury in “such amounts” that the secretary of health and human services estimates would have been “appropriated and expended” for Medicare, Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other “federal public health programs.”  Under Section 901 of the Senate bill, Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program programs would be phased out, as would the Federal Health Benefits Program and the Department of Defense’s Tricare program, providing health coverage for military families.",oppose-medicare
"During the 2009-2010 debate on the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama promised Americans, repeatedly, that if they liked their health plan, they would be able to keep their health plan.",oppose-medicare
"This proved false: Millions of Americans, the vast majority of whom were satisfied with their plans, subsequently lost access to them.",oppose-medicare
"In sponsoring House and Senate “Medicare for All” bills, liberals in Congress are making no such promises to Americans who want to keep their current health coverage.",oppose-medicare
"In fact, they are declaring, in black-and-white legislative language, exactly the opposite.",oppose-medicare
"Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is rewriting the House bill to align the statutory text more closely with Sanders’ comprehensive legislation, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has promised House “progressives” hearings on the measure.",oppose-medicare
"Whether you like your health plan or not, whether it is a good plan or not, your preferences would be utterly irrelevant.",oppose-medicare
"The bills now under consideration would take your existing coverage away, while outlawing any alternative for you and your family.",oppose-medicare
"There would be no choice, and no exit ramp from the progressives’ new health care order.",oppose-medicare
More Bad News for Medicare for All .,oppose-medicare
The hits keep coming for Medicare for All.,oppose-medicare
Gallup’s annual health-care survey of adults found that Americans back a system based on private insurance rather than government provision by 54 percent to 42 percent.,oppose-medicare
"“This could create a challenge in a general election campaign for a Democratic presidential nominee advocating a ‘Medicare for All’ or other healthcare plan that would greatly expand the government’s role in the healthcare system,” writes Jeffrey M. Jones.",oppose-medicare
That’s putting it mildly.,oppose-medicare
"While Democrats prefer a government-run system by 65 percent to 31 percent, Republicans are overwhelming opposed and independents narrowly so.",oppose-medicare
Most Americans say the government should ensure people have health coverage.,oppose-medicare
They disagree over the means.,oppose-medicare
"A government program that would eliminate private health insurance spells doom for presidential campaigns not only because voters recoil at the policy implications, but also because candidates come off as posturing and sophistical when they back away from the “bold, structural change” they once advocated.",oppose-medicare
Progressives continue to flirt with the idea anyway.,oppose-medicare
They can’t help it.,oppose-medicare
The Fallacy of Medicare for All Presidential candidate and self-described Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders currently leads the New Hampshire polls for the Democratic nomination while campaigning on a platform that calls for Medicare for All.,oppose-medicare
"Senator Kamala Harris and some other Democratic presidential candidates are jumping on board the Medicare for All bandwagon, which would extend the government-run health care insurance system to all Americans.",oppose-medicare
"It is ironic that Democratic politicians, after defeating the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and using health care as a rallying cry to win the majority in the House in 2018, now want to toss out ACA and the U.S. insurance system and replace both with a government-run system.",oppose-medicare
The stock market seems to be overreacting to these political pronouncements.,oppose-medicare
"UnitedHealth Group reported an outstanding first quarter that beat expectations, with total revenue up 9%, earnings up 22%, and increased projections for the year.",oppose-medicare
"Nevertheless, its stock dropped nearly 10% in the next two trading sessions, apparently on fears of Medicare for All.",oppose-medicare
"Rival insurers Cigna and Anthem dropped 11% and 8%, respectively.",oppose-medicare
"Health care cost $10,739 per American in 2017.",oppose-medicare
"Middle-class and poorer Americans clearly cannot afford these costs, nor can their employers.",oppose-medicare
"While offering all U.S. citizens free health care using a single-payer system sounds attractive as a political talking point, actually implementing Medicare for All would require a complex restructuring of a multi-trillion dollar industry.",oppose-medicare
The likely result?,oppose-medicare
A disaster.,oppose-medicare
"Covering all Americans under Medicare for All could potentially add another 189 million people to the government’s payrolls, which would swamp the current government approval and payment system—especially since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require prior approval for many medical tests and procedures.",oppose-medicare
"More importantly, the Medicare and Medicaid payment system is almost entirely based on fee for service, wherein hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical dispensers are paid for services rendered.",oppose-medicare
"Naturally, this can incentivize doctors and hospitals to require more office visits, do more procedures, and conduct more tests to get paid more.",oppose-medicare
These perverse incentives are exacerbated by underpayment schedules in which Medicare reimburses well below hospital costs.,oppose-medicare
"In 2017, Medicare and Medicare reimbursement was $76.8 billion below cost and hospitals provided an additional $38.4 billion in uncompensated care.",oppose-medicare
These underpayments force hospitals to increase costs to patients covered by commercial insurance.,oppose-medicare
This cost-shifting distorts the billing system and places an unnecessary cost burden on non-government patients and their employers.,oppose-medicare
"Medicare for All proposes to eliminate the entire commercial insurance industry—putting 538,600 people out of work.",oppose-medicare
The impact on the financial stability of hospitals and doctors would be staggering.,oppose-medicare
A Navigant study found that a typical mid-sized non-profit hospital system would have a net loss of 22% under the plan.,oppose-medicare
"I estimate that half of all hospitals would go out of business, especially smaller hospitals in rural areas.",oppose-medicare
The elimination of existing systems would be offset by a large increase in government payrolls.,oppose-medicare
A Mercatus Center study estimated that Medicare for All would cost the federal government around $32 trillion.,oppose-medicare
These estimates do not include likely increases in Medicare and Medicaid rates required to lessen losses to hospitals and doctors.,oppose-medicare
Who will pay for these enormous costs?,oppose-medicare
"The federal government cannot cover them without new revenue, as the current U.S. debt is already $22 trillion, with the annual deficit exceeding $1 trillion per year in 2020 and beyond.",oppose-medicare
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Medicare for All would require tripling of payroll taxes or more than doubling all other taxes.,oppose-medicare
"The Mercatus Center, however, found that “doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes going forward would be insufficient to fully finance the plan.”  It is easy for voters to support the plan if they think they will get their health care for free, but when they realize their taxes will increase, approval drops dramatically.",oppose-medicare
"A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that net favorability to Medicare for All is negative 23% with when participants hear it would require increases to taxes, and a staggering negative 44% when people hear it would cause delays in getting tests and procedures.",oppose-medicare
"Rather than toss out our current system of health care insurance for a government-run system, it is time to find ways to further improve the ACA.",oppose-medicare
"Here are a few proposals to do that:  First, there should be a shift from “fee for service” to “pay for value,” thus reducing the total cost of the patient’s care.",oppose-medicare
"Second, shift more government-covered people to Medicare Advantage, whereby private insurers receive a sum of money to manage their patients annually.",oppose-medicare
"Third, put a greater emphasis on healthy living.",oppose-medicare
"I estimate that over 50% of health care costs are the result of unhealthy lifestyles such as unhealthy eating and drinking, lack of exercise, and stress.",oppose-medicare
"Greater focus on these areas would prevent people from getting sick in the first place and accelerate healing when they are ill.  Fourth, expand Medicaid coverage to more people experiencing economic difficulties and provide adequate health care before their conditions become severe and they wind up in the emergency room.",oppose-medicare
"Fifth, revise the ACA to permit the federal government to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, while enabling streamlined distribution of drugs from manufacturers to patients with certified physician prescriptions.",oppose-medicare
This would reduce the rapid escalation in drug prices since ACA was enacted.,oppose-medicare
Warren’s Big Bet on Medicare for All Is Not Paying Off Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s once-ascendant presidential campaign has begun to dim.,oppose-medicare
"And among her fellow Democrats, including those in the field, there is a universally agreed upon culprit for the stall in the polls: her embrace and handling of Medicare for All.",oppose-medicare
"The senator’s decision to back single-payer health care has long been considered by establishment Democrats as a self-inflicted wound, one that would prove to be a massive weight on her in a general election should she get there.",oppose-medicare
One senior Democratic Party member—who is philosophically supportive of Warren’s candidacy—said he was “dumbfounded” by her decision to align herself so closely with the proposal.,oppose-medicare
"“She’s completely boxed herself in,” the member said.",oppose-medicare
“I just don’t see why she did it or how she gets out of it.”    Both Warren supporters and Medicare for All advocates have dismissed such prognostications as the bed-wetting cynicism of a timid—and corporate-influenced—consultant class.,oppose-medicare
"And through it all they’ve had an easy rejoinder to the collective freakout: Beyond the moral argument for Medicare for All, polling has continually showed it to be popular.",oppose-medicare
But that now appears to be changing.,oppose-medicare
"A new national Quinnipiac University poll of the Democratic primary field showed Warren slipping dramatically, down 14 percentage points from their survey one month prior.",oppose-medicare
And tucked into the survey was a possible explanation as to why.,oppose-medicare
"The pollsters tested support for Medicare for All and found that only 36 percent of the public said it was a good idea (52 percent said it was bad) compared to March 2019, when 43 percent said good idea, while 45 percent said bad.",oppose-medicare
Singular polls are bad barometers for the state of elections or politics in general.,oppose-medicare
But other polling paints a similar picture.,oppose-medicare
"The Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking public opinion on health care policy closer than anyone else, has recorded a majority support for a national health care plan—styled as Medicare for All—for years.",oppose-medicare
But they noted that “the level of support has narrowed in recent months.” And the most recent data found that “more Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents would prefer voting for a candidate who wants to build on [Obamacare] in order to expand coverage and reduce costs rather than replace [Obamacare] with a national Medicare-for-all plan.”   Whether Warren’s regression and the fall of support for Medicare for All is a matter of correlation or causation has become the topic of intense internal debate in Democratic circles.,oppose-medicare
"And for the Senator’s more moderate competitors in the primary, the conclusions are fairly easy to draw: the shifting tides of opinion on health care are damaging her candidacy.",oppose-medicare
"“I think it’s that Medicare for All is poison,” said a senior aide to another 2020 Democrat.",oppose-medicare
“It is fucking poison.,oppose-medicare
"You touch it, you turn to dust.”  Warren’s campaign declined to comment for this piece.",oppose-medicare
But her supporters point to a different explanation for the data: Democratic elites are fearful of Warren’s general election prospects and are going after Medicare for All as a proxy.,oppose-medicare
"“People really like Warren and on the merits, and they probably would pick her as the nominee,” said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic operative who may be the Senator’s most pugnacious supporter online.",oppose-medicare
"“But the biggest fear about her is electability and you had a month where those fears were exacerbated from the New York Times poll [showing Warren faring poorly in swing states] to people turning Medicare for All into an electibility issue.”   To that end, Jentleson noted that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama have both aired their skepticism with Medicare for All in recent weeks—giving Democratic voters a permission structure to drift away from Warren’s candidacy.",oppose-medicare
"But for Warren’s fellow ideological travelers, the fact that party elites have come out in opposition to Medicare for All isn’t the only problem she faces.",oppose-medicare
"The manner in which she’s handled the policy has played a role, too.",oppose-medicare
The Massachusetts Democrat has taken a less than direct path toward championing the idea.,oppose-medicare
"Though Warren endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal while the two served together in the Senate, she spent months on the campaign trail not fleshing out her health care platform.",oppose-medicare
It was only during the June debate that she formally took the plunge.,oppose-medicare
"On health care policy, she said, “I’m with Bernie.”  Far from simplifying matters, that declaration only compounded the questions, even more so as Warren refused to answer whether a hike in middle class taxes would be needed in order to pay for a plan with estimated costs ranging from $13 trillion to $34 trillion.",oppose-medicare
"At first, she strenuously made the point that such a debate was inherently illogical.",oppose-medicare
"Money is money and if one’s premiums and copays go down by a larger share than their taxes go up then, fundamentally, Medicare for All will be a net financial positive.",oppose-medicare
"It made no sense, Warren implored, to only consider the proposal through the prism of a tax bill.",oppose-medicare

"Instead, the Vermont Independent questioned her plan to continue placing the cost burden on employers (Warren’s plan largely maintains the health care contributions such employers make but shifts them to a government health care system).",oppose-medicare
"Privately, his surrogates dinged her for buying into the proposition that simply raising taxes was politically untenable.",oppose-medicare
"Warren gave them more fodder weeks later when she introduced the procedural component of her health care plan: a proposal to first pass a so-called public option for health insurance coverage (in which people would have the choice to buy a government plan) before, years later, shifting towards Medicare for All (in which no such choice would be available).",oppose-medicare
"That Warren’s disjointed journey on health care policy has hampered her candidacy more so than the policy itself, may be evident by the fact that Sanders has seen his standing tick up slightly as Warren has stumbled.",oppose-medicare

"If you want to understand why Rebecca Wood supports Medicare for All, you have to understand the story of her mouth.",pro-medicare
"In 2015, Wood cracked a tooth.",pro-medicare
"Around the same time, her daughter, Charlie, began to speak.",pro-medicare
"Charlie was already 3 years old, but her premature birth had left her with delayed speech and in need of extensive therapies.",pro-medicare
"When a payment for Charlie’s speech therapy came due, Wood, who had stopped working so she could take care of her daughter, had to make a choice.",pro-medicare
"Should she pay for a root canal and crown for herself, or pay for Charlie’s therapy?",pro-medicare
"Wood could only afford one, she told me recently.",pro-medicare
"Deciding not to risk losing momentum on Charlie’s language skills, she opted to postpone the root canal.",pro-medicare
"But before she could get the procedure done, she developed an infection that spread throughout her entire mouth and jaw.",pro-medicare
A dentist had to drain her infection and scrape away part of her jaw under local anesthesia; Wood could not afford to be put completely under.,pro-medicare
The dentist also pulled every one of her teeth.,pro-medicare
"“I told myself, This is the price of a miracle,” Wood said of her daughter.",pro-medicare
The choice she was forced to make still stings—sometimes literally.,pro-medicare
"Wood now has dentures, and they fit poorly.",pro-medicare
Her dental insurance only covers a new pair every five years.,pro-medicare
"Throughout this saga, Wood was frustrated that her health insurance didn’t protect her from staggering bills and difficult choices.",pro-medicare
It felt like politicians didn’t care.,pro-medicare
She decided that “the only way we’re going to ever have health-care justice is if the guys writing the policies have to live by it.” That would mean everyone would have the same health-insurance plan.,pro-medicare
Which would mean Medicare for All.,pro-medicare
"In 2017, Wood spoke at a Bernie Sanders press conference on universal health care.",pro-medicare
"This past June, she testified at a congressional hearing on universal health coverage.",pro-medicare
"She now works full-time for Mass-Care, a Massachusetts-based nonprofit advocating for Medicare for All.",pro-medicare
Not every single-payer advocate’s story is as heartbreaking as Wood’s.,pro-medicare
"But Medicare for All—otherwise known as single-payer health care—has taken on an astonishing popularity among Democrats and independents in recent years, rising from a fringe, socialist hobbyhorse to a policy seriously and frequently considered during the Democratic primary debates.",pro-medicare
"In 2016, it was the special quirk of Sanders’s candidacy; now 11 candidates support some version of it.",pro-medicare
"Single-payer health care, the kind that exists in Canada and some European countries, would make medical care free or nearly free for all Americans.",pro-medicare
"Under some versions of these plans, private insurance would be eliminated, and all Americans would be covered under one, government-run plan, similar to Medicare.",pro-medicare
Wood and a half-dozen other supporters of Medicare for All told me about the deep physical and emotional wounds that brought them into the fold.,pro-medicare
"Most either have or recently had health insurance, but they say it wasn’t enough to protect them or their family members from death, illness, or debt.",pro-medicare
"Medicare for All strikes many as the easiest way to stop the health-care madness, even if the political path to it isn’t yet clear.",pro-medicare
They’ve grown disgusted with the American health-care system and reached the conclusion that blowing up the system is the only way forward.,pro-medicare
"In a way, the rallying cry of single-payer harkens back to President Barack Obama’s use of, in the dark days of the 2008 recession, uplifting slogans like “Hope,” “Change,” and “Yes, we can.” Most people didn’t know exactly how “hope” would lead us out of economic gloom.",pro-medicare
"But just as with health care today, they were pretty sure it couldn’t get any worse.",pro-medicare
"Though the exact number depends on the poll and the way the question is asked, a slim majority of Americans—51 percent—now support Medicare for All, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.",pro-medicare

"“Any program that is going to create more taxes, take away health-care choices, or outlaw private health coverage entirely becomes a nonstarter.”  The main proponents of single-payer in the Democratic race, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have defended their plans against these attacks and more.",pro-medicare
"And the fact is, many supporters of this plan don’t need all the details.",pro-medicare
"The horrors of American health care have become so clear that Medicare for All feels, to many, like a refreshing breeze of simplicity.",pro-medicare
Medicare for All is easy to understand and promote on social media.,pro-medicare

"Medicare for All is “short and catchy,” says Adam Hodges, a linguist at the University of Colorado at Boulder who specializes in political slogans.",pro-medicare
"And employing Medicare, a system that most Americans are familiar with, makes the concept seem less complex and unknown.",pro-medicare
"Still, it’s a bit surprising that single-payer is gaining speed now, because Physicians for a National Health Program, the main American organization dedicated to the single-payer issue, was formed in the late ’80s.",pro-medicare

"According to a recent study, 45 percent of Americans are worried a major illness could leave them bankrupt, 1 out of 4 Americans skipped needed medical care because they could not afford it, and 77 percent are concerned rising health costs will cause significant and lasting damage to our economy.",pro-medicare
We spend more on health care and get worse results.,pro-medicare
"According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, we spend more than $10,700 per capita on health care.",pro-medicare

Our current health care system puts profits over people.,pro-medicare
"The ongoing failure of our health care system is directly attributable to the fact that - - unique among major nations -- it is primarily designed not to provide quality care to all in a cost-effective way, but to maximize profits for health insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry and medical equipment suppliers.",pro-medicare

We'd be able to save up to $500 billion annually in billing and administrative costs under Medicare for All.,pro-medicare
That money could be used to greatly expand primary care in this country and make certain that all Americans got the health care they needed when they needed it -- saving billions on expensive emergency room care and hospital visits.,pro-medicare

Medicare for All saves middle class families thousands of dollars.,pro-medicare

Medicare for All is good for businesses.,pro-medicare
"A Medicare-for-all system not only benefits individuals and families, it would benefit the business community.",pro-medicare
Small- and medium-sized businesses would be free to focus on their core business goals instead of wasting precious energy and resources navigating an incredibly complex system to provide health insurance to their employees.,pro-medicare
"Bottom line: If every major country on earth can guarantee health care to all and achieve better health outcomes, while spending substantially less per capita than we do, it is absurd for anyone to suggest that the United States of America cannot do the same.",pro-medicare
"Summary of the bill Coverage for all This legislation will create a federal universal health insurance program to provide comprehensive coverage for all Americans including inpatient and outpatient hospital care; emergency services; primary and preventive services; prescription drugs; mental health and substance abuse treatment; maternity and newborn care; pediatrics; home- and community-based long-term services and supports; dental, audiology, and vision services.",pro-medicare
What will this bill mean for patients?,pro-medicare
"As a patient, all your basic needs are covered.",pro-medicare
You choose your doctor.,pro-medicare
"No deductibles, no surprise bills for out-of-network services, no copays.",pro-medicare
"If you change jobs, you don’t have to change insurance plans or worry about losing the coverage you and your family depend on.",pro-medicare
"No more worrying about whether you can afford to get the care you need, or how to pick the right insurance plan for your family.",pro-medicare
What will it mean for providers?,pro-medicare
Health care providers can spend more time with their patients and less time with paperwork.,pro-medicare
"A universal health care system will also allow the country to invest more resources in provider education and training, and make smart investments to avoid provider shortages and ensure communities can access the providers they need.",pro-medicare
What will it mean for employers?,pro-medicare
"Instead of struggling to provide health insurance to employees, businesses will simply pay a payroll tax—just like they do for Medicare now.",pro-medicare
"More freedom, more security Under this bill, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment.",pro-medicare
"That freedom would not only help the American people live happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives, but it would also promote innovation and entrepreneurship in every sector of the economy.",pro-medicare
"People would be able to start new businesses, stay home with their children or leave jobs they don’t like knowing that they would still have health care coverage for themselves and their families.",pro-medicare
Employers would be free to focus on running their business rather than spending countless hours figuring out how to provide health insurance to their employees.,pro-medicare
Working Americans wouldn’t have to choose between bargaining for higher wages or better health insurance.,pro-medicare
Parents wouldn’t have to worry about how to provide health insurance to their children.,pro-medicare
Seniors and people with serious or chronic illnesses could afford the care necessary to keep them healthy without worry of financial ruin.,pro-medicare

Universal health care is more myth than reality.,pro-medicare
Medicare for all is a decent step toward it  Millions of Americans live with health care coverage that is either incredibly expensive or poor to nonexistent.,pro-medicare
"It’s no surprise, then, that the push is on throughout the country for some form of universal health care, such as the Medicare for All plan promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).",pro-medicare
Is the idea of a universal health care system that’s paid for and run by the government and has only trivial out-of-pocket costs truly plausible?,pro-medicare
I’ve been following health care for some 35 years.,pro-medicare
"So just out of curiosity, I decided to look at European countries with universal health care.",pro-medicare
"They’ve appeared to be the utopian goal for health care for many of us over the years, thinking “If we could only get there!”  I was surprised to discover two unsettling realities.",pro-medicare
"One of them is that there is no such thing as universal health care, if by that we mean full and free health care paid for by the government.",pro-medicare
The other is that the U.S. is in an odd position.,pro-medicare
"Our government pays a larger per-capita percentage of our health care costs than any other country, yet we have out-of-pocket costs that aren’t greatly out of line with other countries.",pro-medicare
Here is a brief summary of data compiled by the Commonwealth Fund of 13 mostly European high-income countries that tells the story.,pro-medicare
"Health care spending as a percent of gross domestic product is highest in the U.S., at 17 percent.",pro-medicare
"That is 50 percent higher than in runner-up France, at 11.6 percent.",pro-medicare
"As in the U.S., all of the European systems have out-of-pocket costs.",pro-medicare
"In this category, Switzerland topped the list, averaging at $1,630 per person per year, followed by the U.S at $1,074.",pro-medicare
"The lowest out-of-pocket spending by far was the U.K., at $321.",pro-medicare
"When it comes to public financing of health care, the U.S. is the leader, with per-capita spending of $9,086.",pro-medicare
"Yet despite that investment plus modest out-of-pocket spending, life expectancy in the U.S. is lower than it is in any European country.",pro-medicare
It is also worth noting that one can easily find Europeans bemoaning the state of their health care systems.,pro-medicare
"A 2017 report by the British House of Lords said that “Our NHS, our ‘national religion’ is in crisis and the adult social care system is on the brink of collapse.” Another analysis found that that, “Across the world, universal care is in bad shape.”  The greatest obstacle to a Medicare-for-all plan is that it would, not surprisingly, be prohibitively costly.",pro-medicare
Neither Sanders nor the Congressional Budget Office has calculated its costs.,pro-medicare
"A recent estimate from the Mercatus Center projected that it would increase the federal budget by approximately $36.6 trillion in its first 10 years, although Sanders and others dispute the findings.",pro-medicare
"Enthusiasm for a single-payer plan has been strong in California, but legislative progress in that direction has stalled because of its projected costs.",pro-medicare
What I find most disturbing is the comparatively low U.S. life expectancy despite high government spending.,pro-medicare
"The culprit is at least three-headed: inefficiency, high labor and technology costs, and political and other barriers to government control of drug costs and expensive technologies.",pro-medicare
"There is hardly any guarantee that a Medicare for all plan could cut through all those obstacles, or even come close to doing so.",pro-medicare
Related: We are America’s future doctors.,pro-medicare
We support a Medicare-for-all health system Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),pro-medicare
has proposed an alternative plan.,pro-medicare
She judges that a single-payer plan would be difficult to get through Congress and concedes that private insurance will have to continue.,pro-medicare
"But that insurance would “have to be at least as good and priced as reasonably as the coverage provided by our public health care programs.” The obvious advantage of her plan is that it aims to build upon and improve the embattled Affordable Care Act, likely making it easier to get through Congress than a single-payer plan.",pro-medicare
Warren’s plan would benefit from the strong gain in public support for the ACA over the past couple of years despite assaults on it by President Trump and other Republicans.,pro-medicare
It would be foolish to think that it will be possible in the years ahead to devise an ideal or perfect health care system.,pro-medicare
"The number of Americans age 65 or older, now at nearly 51 million, will rapidly continue to grow, as will medical and technological ways to keep them alive longer.",pro-medicare
"A major consequence will be longer lives, with new drugs and expensive devices to keep people alive longer.",pro-medicare
"Hardly less important, there will be a historic turning point by 2035: The number of those over 65 (78 million) is projected to exceed those under 18 (76.7 million).",pro-medicare
"Even with great public support for affordable universal care, European countries are stumbling and gasping.",pro-medicare
The U.S. is likely to do the same.,pro-medicare
"Some improved form of universal care will help, but there is no magic elixir, here or there, to find a politically affordable program covering all health needs.",pro-medicare
But progress is possible.,pro-medicare
Two congressional moves would make a great difference.,pro-medicare
One of them would be to rescind the 2003 law prohibiting the Department of Health and Human Services from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries.,pro-medicare
"The other would be to set an income-based limit on out-of-pocket health expenses, with government paying the difference.",pro-medicare
"While I believe that Trump’s view of Medicare for All, which he laid out in a recent op-ed for USA Today, is wrong, its very grandiosity opens the door to resistance.",pro-medicare
"Nonetheless, there is a need for a stronger and more equitable health care system, and Warren’s plan so far is the most plausible.",pro-medicare
THE MOVEMENT FOR single-payer health care has taken some big strides forward in recent years.,pro-medicare
"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., put the issue at the center of the Democratic Party’s debate with his run for president in 2016.",pro-medicare
"In partnership with the nurses union and other champions, he then got 19 senators to co-sponsor his bill in 2017.",pro-medicare
"After Democrats took back the House of Representatives, we demanded and got hearings in multiple powerful committees on the fantastic bill spearheaded by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. (The successor to that of the progressive hero and former Michigan Rep. John Conyers, who died this week.)",pro-medicare
"These were our victories, earned by a movement that has been fighting for many decades.",pro-medicare
The plan that Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren just released is another enormous win for us.,pro-medicare
"It will help persuade our friends and families and neighbors to support Medicare for All, and in the not-too-distant future, to convince Congress too.",pro-medicare
Here’s why.,pro-medicare
"To begin, her plan covers everybody, with zero out-of-pocket expenses.",pro-medicare
“Medicare for All” is a great brand.,pro-medicare
"So is “Free Healthcare for Everybody.” And that’s the central promise of the Sanders and Jayapal bills, and the Warren proposal as well.",pro-medicare
"You get the doctors and caregivers and treatments you need, for free.",pro-medicare
It is a deeply appealing vision (as evidenced by the enthusiasm that Bernie generates among the working class) that we can use to drive enormous turnout from voters who often stay home out of cynicism about what either party will do for them.,pro-medicare
Eliminating the cost of health care will mean many thousands of dollars back every year for families throughout the country.,pro-medicare
It’ll come to $11 trillion in savings over 10 years.,pro-medicare
"For my sisters and brothers in red, let me put it this way: It would represent the largest redistribution of wealth since the Great Society, or maybe the New Deal, or maybe even the Emancipation Proclamation.",pro-medicare
(Can some economists or historians help me out here?),pro-medicare
"Warren shows how a single-payer system, and only a single-payer system, will dramatically reduce costs.",pro-medicare
But won’t the government take it all back in taxes?,pro-medicare
"This, my comrades, is where Senator Warren performs what is perhaps the greatest feat of public policy jujitsu that I have ever seen.",pro-medicare
Her plan doesn’t raise taxes on working families.,pro-medicare
"Lately, debate moderators have been salivating at the idea of getting Warren to admit that her plan will be paid for by creating a new employer-side tax.",pro-medicare
"(Bernie has already said as much — because he’s a no-bullshit, courageous guy, and everyone has been assuming that it would be necessary.)",pro-medicare
And her debate-stage admission would then be the subject of a billion dollars in Republican advertisements.,pro-medicare
"This was the trap that was being set for Warren, according smart observers like Paul Krugman and Zach Carter, and it could have disastrous political consequences.",pro-medicare
(They even had me worried.,pro-medicare
But then Warren did what she does best: her fucking homework.,pro-medicare
"She consulted the experts, she double-checked the numbers, and she dropped a codex of wisdom right in the middle of the teacher’s desk.",pro-medicare
And the political reverberations may be felt for decades.,pro-medicare
Just imagine what will happen when the debate moderators ask her next time how she’ll pay for her plan.,pro-medicare
She can answer honestly and with authority that Medicare for All will mean zero health care costs and no increases in taxes for all but the wealthiest Americans.,pro-medicare
So how does she pay for it?,pro-medicare
Here is where the brilliance of this plan’s political economy really shines brightest.,pro-medicare
Warren pays for her plan by targeting the bad actors who are making our health care system so expensive and wasteful and our economy so rigged and unequal.,pro-medicare
"On the revenue side, she eliminates the ability of corporations to hide their profits overseas and the ability of megawealthy families like the Kochs and the Waltons and the Sacklers to avoid taxes through accounting gimmicks and the capital gains loophole.",pro-medicare
She bumps up her wealth tax.,pro-medicare
"She funds the IRS properly, so the agency can actually collect that revenue (Republican lobbyists and lawmakers have starved it for decades because they are, um, corrupt).",pro-medicare
And then the plan fills in the revenue with an employer-side tax that is equal to current employer health care expenses.,pro-medicare
"(Warren makes some smart decisions in order to reward, rather than penalize, high-road employers who are currently providing great health care coverage and especially those with unionized workforces.",pro-medicare
"It’s a clever way to encourage corporations to let their workers unionize, and if you’re interested in that level of detail, you should go read the plan).",pro-medicare
"Then, Warren shows how a single-payer system, and only a single-payer system, will dramatically reduce costs.",pro-medicare
"This is what all credible analyses make clear: With only Medicare paying the bills, we get huge savings.",pro-medicare
Administrative costs plummet.,pro-medicare
Wasteful billing and cost-shifting disappears.,pro-medicare
Outrageous drug prices get negotiated down to something reasonable.,pro-medicare
This is why Medicare for All works so much better than the public-option plans that other candidates are offering.,pro-medicare
We can’t get those savings if “Medicare for all who want it”  is competing with a bunch of private insurers.,pro-medicare
"Doctors and hospitals wouldn’t save any money or time, like they would under single payer.",pro-medicare
"And we wouldn’t be able to rein in absurd expenses from the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, or monopoly hospital corporations.",pro-medicare
(She also cuts immoral and wasteful spending on wars.,pro-medicare
"Yes, please.)",pro-medicare
"I’m in Historically, single-payer advocates have focused on the human benefits of more and better health care coverage.",pro-medicare
And rightfully so.,pro-medicare
That is what matters the most.,pro-medicare
"But we’ve simultaneously shied away from discussing the cost, because the numbers are just so big.",pro-medicare
And that is why this plan is such a landmark.,pro-medicare
It turns our perceived weakness into a powerful strength.,pro-medicare
"From now on, when we’re asked how to pay for the program, we can point to the very same corporate interests who are trying to defeat us.",pro-medicare
"Do the numbers add up, or is this a hocus-pocus political trick?",pro-medicare
"You won’t be surprised that various fancy, respected policy wonks helped run the calculations and fill in the details.",pro-medicare
We shouldn’t be surprised.,pro-medicare
"After all, Warren spent most of her career as one of the nation’s experts on middle-class family costs, and wrote one of the major game-changing studies exposing the severity of medical bankruptcies.",pro-medicare

"It was the height of the Reagan Revolution, but they had inherited from their forebears a vision for a more just and equitable society — in which health care is finally treated as a human right.",pro-medicare

"Support for Medicare for All in Congress Just Got Very Real  Just one election cycle ago, the idea of either chamber of Congress passing a single-payer health plan was unthinkable.",pro-medicare
That was then.,pro-medicare
"Now, a simple majority of House Democrats support Medicare for All, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.",pro-medicare
And it hit that key metric thanks to the endorsement this week by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York).,pro-medicare
"Jeffries is the 118th member of the House to back the bill, introduced in February, which would install a government-run health system.",pro-medicare
"“Given the enduring nature of our health care access and affordability crisis, more must be done,” Jeffries, who some Democrats view as a likely successor to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), told the Post.",pro-medicare
"But despite the support from her caucus, Pelosi has resisted holding a vote on the bill, introduced by Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).",pro-medicare
"In April, Pelosi said she was “agnostic” on Medicare for All, and expressed doubt that the bill would deliver what it promises.",pro-medicare
"“Show me how you think you can get there,” Pelosi told the Post at the time.",pro-medicare
"“We all share the value of health care for all Americans — quality, affordable health care for all Americans.",pro-medicare
What is the path to that?,pro-medicare
"I think it’s the Affordable Care Act, and if that leads to Medicare for All, that may be the path.”  Pelosi was also speaker when Congress approved then-President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, and played a critical role in getting it passed.",pro-medicare
"Jayapal’s version of Medicare for All varies slightly from the version introduced in the Senate by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate.",pro-medicare
"But both would implement a government-run, national health care system that sets low caps on drug prices and allows consumers to pay next to nothing out of pocket.",pro-medicare
Both would also eliminate private insurance.,pro-medicare
"Voters, too, are slowly coming around to the idea.",pro-medicare
"The majority of Americans support the concept of a national health system, and Kaiser Family Foundation research shows that support increasing when pollsters ask voters specifically about Medicare for All.",pro-medicare
"RealClear Opinion Research polls show that 82% of Democrats, and about half of Republicans, support the policy.",pro-medicare
"That’s reflected in this year’s presidential race, too.",pro-medicare
Two of the three highest-polling Democrats running for president — Sens.,pro-medicare
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.),pro-medicare
— support Medicare for All.,pro-medicare
"""We remain the only major country on earth that allows chief executives and stockholders in the health care industry to get incredibly rich, while tens of millions of people suffer because they can't get the health care they need,"" Sanders wrote in a 2017 New York Times op-ed defending the policy.",pro-medicare
"""This is not what the United States should be about.""",pro-medicare
"OPTIONS TO FINANCE MEDICARE FOR ALL Introduction Today, the United States spends more than $3.2 trillion a year on health care.",pro-medicare
"About sixty-five percent of this funding, over $2 trillion, is spent on publicly financed health care programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs.",pro-medicare
"At $10,000 per person, the United States spends far more on health care per capita and as a percentage of GDP than any other country on earth in both the public and private sectors while still leaving 28 million Americans uninsured and millions more under-insured.",pro-medicare
"Today, health care spending in the U.S. accounts for nearly 18 percent of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is on track to total over 20 percent of GDP over the next decade.",pro-medicare
It is projected that if we do nothing and maintain our current dysfunctional system that we will spend $49 trillion over the next decade on health care.,pro-medicare
"That would be an incredible burden on businesses, working families, and the entire economy.",pro-medicare
The most cost-effective and popular solution to this health care crisis is to guarantee health care as a right through a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care system.,pro-medicare
"Today, the traditional Medicare program only spends two percent of its costs on administration.",pro-medicare
That’s less than one-sixth the administrative costs of private health insurance companies.,pro-medicare
"Studies have found that our federal government could save up to $500 billion per year on administrative costs by moving to a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system.",pro-medicare
"Moreover, the United States pays, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because Congress has done nothing to regulate the price of medicine.",pro-medicare
"If the U.S. joined the rest of the industrialized world and negotiated with the pharmaceutical companies to lower prices, our country could save up to $113 billion per year.",pro-medicare
"As the wealthiest country in the world, we have a variety of options available to support a Medicare for All single-payer health care system that guarantees high quality, affordable health care as a right, not a privilege, to every man, woman, and child in this country.",pro-medicare
This paper explains just some of the policies that could provide revenue to finance Medicare for All.,pro-medicare
Under every single one of these options the average American family will save thousands of dollars a year because they will no longer be writing large checks to private health insurance companies.,pro-medicare
"If every major industrialized nation on Earth can make health care a right, provide universal coverage to all, achieve far better health outcomes in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality, while spending far less per capita than we do, it is absurd to suggest the United States of America, the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, cannot do the same.",pro-medicare
"In my view, there needs to be vigorous debate as to the best way to finance our Medicare for All legislation.",pro-medicare
"Unlike the Republican leadership in Congress which held no hearings on their  disastrous bill which would have thrown 32 million off of health insurance and dealt with onesixth of the American economy, it is our intention to get the best ideas we can from economists, doctors, nurses, and ordinary Americans.",pro-medicare
Below are a number of options to begin that discussion.,pro-medicare
Under each and every one of these options the average American family will end up in a better financial position than they are under the current system.,pro-medicare
Options to Save Families and Businesses on Health Care Expenses 7.5 percent income-based premium paid by employers Revenue raised: $3.9 trillion over ten years.,pro-medicare
"Businesses would save over $9,000 in health care costs for the average employee under this option In 2016, employers paid an average of $12,865 in private health insurance premiums for a worker with a family of four who makes $50,000 a year.",pro-medicare
"Under this option, employers would pay a 7.5 percent payroll tax to help finance Medicare for All – just $3,750 – a savings of more than $9,000 a year for that employee.",pro-medicare
"During the four-year transition period to guarantee health care as a right, millions of workers will have the option to transfer from their employer-provided health care to the new Medicare for All system.",pro-medicare
"As workers shift into the new system, employers will be required to pay either 75 percent of what they are currently paying for health care costs for each of their employees who enroll in Medicare for All, or the 7.5 percent payroll tax, whichever is higher.",pro-medicare
An employer’s first $2 million in payroll would be exempt from this premium protecting small businesses throughout the country.,pro-medicare
4 percent income-based premium paid by households Revenue raised: $3.5 trillion over ten years.,pro-medicare
"The typical middle class family would save over $4,400 under this plan.",pro-medicare
"Last year the typical working family paid an average of $5,277 in premiums to private health insurance companies.",pro-medicare
"Under this option, a typical family of four earning $50,000, after taking the standard deduction, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All – just $844 a year – saving that family over $4,400 a year.",pro-medicare
"Because of the standard deduction, families of four making less than $29,000 a year would not pay this premium.",pro-medicare
Savings from Health Tax Expenditures Revenue raised: $4.2 trillion over ten years.,pro-medicare
Several tax breaks that subsidize health care would become obsolete and disappear under Medicare for All.,pro-medicare
The biggest health expenditure is the preference that excludes employer-paid premiums from payroll and income taxes.,pro-medicare
This is a significant tax break that would be eliminated under this plan because all Americans would receive health care through the new  Medicare for All program instead of employer-based health care.,pro-medicare
The exclusion for contributions to cafeteria plans and the medical expense deduction will also be eliminated.,pro-medicare
Options to Make the Wealthy Pay Their Fair Share Make the Personal Income Tax More Progressive Revenue raised: $1.8 trillion over ten years.,pro-medicare
"Another option is to reform the personal income tax system by strengthening progressive income tax rates, taxing capital gains and dividends the same as work income, limiting deductions for the wealthy, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, and requiring derivatives to be marked to market.",pro-medicare
o Progressive income tax rates.,pro-medicare
"Under this plan the marginal income tax rate would be: § 40 percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000.",pro-medicare
"§ 45 percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million.",pro-medicare
§ 50 percent on income between $2 million and $10 million.,pro-medicare
"(In 2014, only 136,000 households, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, had income between $2 million and $10 million.)",pro-medicare
§ 52 percent on income above $10 million.,pro-medicare
"(In 2014, only 16,700 households, just 0.02 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10 million.)",pro-medicare
o Taxing capital gains and dividends the same as income from work.,pro-medicare
"Warren Buffett, the second-wealthiest American in the country, has said that he pays a lower effective tax rate than his secretary.",pro-medicare
"This is because he receives most of his income from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a much lower rate than income from work.",pro-medicare
"This option would end the special tax break for capital gains and dividends on household income above $250,000, treating this income the same as income earned from working.",pro-medicare
Taxing all income received by the rich at the same rates would simplify the tax code and eliminate the opportunities to game the system by making other types of income appear to be capital gains or dividends.,pro-medicare
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 68 percent of the benefits of the special income tax rates for capital gains and dividends went to the richest one percent of Americans in 2013. o Limit tax deductions for the wealthy.,pro-medicare
Wealthier households are able to take advantage of various itemized deductions that generally do not provide any benefit to lower income workers.,pro-medicare
"Under this proposal, itemized deductions would be capped at 28 percent for households making over $250,000.",pro-medicare
"In other words, for every dollar in tax deduction a high-income household could save at most 28 cents.",pro-medicare
This limit would replace more complicated and less effective limits on tax breaks for the rich.,pro-medicare
Make the Estate Tax More Progressive Revenue raised: $249 billion over ten years.,pro-medicare
Currently the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans.,pro-medicare
"In other words, 99.8 percent are not impacted by this tax.",pro-medicare
"Under this option, the estate tax would return to the exemptions that were in effect in 2009 and rates would be made more progressive.",pro-medicare
"Specifically, the plan would exempt the first $3.5 million of a single person’s estate and the first $7 million of a married couple’s estate.",pro-medicare
The existing flat 40 percent estate tax rate would be replaced with the following progressive rates: o 45 percent for the value of an estate between $3.5 million and $10 million.,pro-medicare
o 50 percent for the value of an estate between $10 million and $50 million.,pro-medicare
o 55 percent for the value of an estate in excess of $50 million.,pro-medicare
o An additional 10 percent surtax would apply to estate value in excess of $500 million ($1 billion for married couples).,pro-medicare
"Further, the proposal: o Closes loopholes for “grantor retained annuity trusts” (GRATs) and other types of trusts and valuation techniques that have allowed the Walton family of Wal-Mart and other billionaires to save over $100 billion in taxes since 2000; and o Increases existing protections for farmland and conservation.",pro-medicare
Establish a Wealth Tax on the Top 0.1 percent Revenue raised: $1.3 trillion over ten years.,pro-medicare
Over the past several decades America has experienced an explosion of wealth concentration.,pro-medicare
"Today the wealthiest 0.1 percent – just 160,000 households – own nearly the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90 percent.",pro-medicare
"Meanwhile, a report from the Institute on Policy Studies concludes that America’s 20 richest individuals now own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the American population.",pro-medicare
This severe inequality threatens to warp our democracy by concentrating too much power in the hands of a tiny elite.,pro-medicare
"It also holds back our economy, funneling resources to a few families rather than creating the broad base of middle-class consumers that can drive economic growth.",pro-medicare
This option would establish an annual 1 percent federal wealth tax on the net worth of the wealthiest 0.1 percent of U.S. households.,pro-medicare
The tax would apply to net worth exceeding $21 million for a household.,pro-medicare
"That means a household with $21.5 million would pay 1 percent of $500,000, or $5,000.",pro-medicare
Close the Gingrich-Edwards Loophole and Create Parity for Wealthy Business Owners Revenue raised: $247 billion over ten years.,pro-medicare
This option closes the Gingrich-Edwards loophole which allows individuals who own and run an S-Corporation to game the system and avoid paying payroll taxes by claiming some income as business profits.,pro-medicare
"Under current law, these business owners are required to report a “reasonable” amount of salary income and pay the appropriate amount of payroll tax.",pro-medicare
"However, many times these individuals deliberately under-report a reasonable salary in order to avoid these taxes.",pro-medicare
"Additionally, this option would ensure that all business income of high-income people would be subject to the existing 3.8 percent tax to fund Medicare, either through the net investment income tax or the additional Medicare tax on earned income.",pro-medicare
"These taxes were designed to ensure that high-income people pay the 3.8 percent Medicare tax on all income, regardless of the source.",pro-medicare
"However, some business income slips through the crack and is not subject to either tax.",pro-medicare
This proposal would close that loophole.,pro-medicare
"Options to Make Wall Street and Large, Profitable Corporation Pay Their Fair Share Impose a one-time tax on currently held offshore profits Revenue raised: $767 billion over ten years.",pro-medicare
For years corporations have been avoiding paying their fair share of taxes by stashing their cash in the Cayman Islands and other offshore tax havens where there is no corporate income tax rate.,pro-medicare
"This situation has become so absurd that one five-story office building in the Cayman Islands is the “home” to close to 20,000 companies.",pro-medicare
Today corporations hold a staggering $2.6 trillion offshore in order to avoid paying taxes in the U.S.,pro-medicare
"Under current law, a corporation does not pay corporate taxes on these profits until it sends, or “repatriates”, the money back to the U.S.",pro-medicare
"This option would require these companies to pay a one-time tax now, based on what they owe under current law.",pro-medicare
Impose a Fee on Large Financial Institutions Revenue raised: $117 billion over ten years.,pro-medicare
"Today, the six major financial institutions in this country have over $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 56 percent of our entire GDP.",pro-medicare
"The largest financial institution, JP Morgan Chase, has received more than $22.2 billion in tax breaks since 2008.",pro-medicare
"Meanwhile, during the financial crisis, JP Morgan Chase received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve.",pro-medicare
It is time that Wall Street start paying its fair share in taxes.,pro-medicare
"One option would be to impose a fee of seven basis points (.07 percent) on covered liabilities of financial institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, as proposed by President Obama.",pro-medicare
Repeal Corporate Accounting Gimmicks Revenue raised: $112 billion ten years.,pro-medicare
"This option would eliminate the “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) accounting method that allows corporations to manipulate their inventory and make it appear like they have lower profits.",pro-medicare
"They do this by deducting the higher cost of newer inventory, rather than the lower cost of older  inventory, resulting in lower profits and lower taxes.",pro-medicare
Democrats and Republicans have both supported repealing LIFO in various budget and tax reform proposals.,pro-medicare
"Health care is among the most important issues for Democratic voters as they are sizing up their candidates running for president in the 2020 election, polls show.",pro-medicare
"And when it comes to health care, discussion about proposed “Medicare for All” plans have dominated the Democratic debates.",pro-medicare
These sweeping legislative proposals would provide health insurance to every American.,pro-medicare
They would fundamentally restructure the health care system to address rising costs and take most commercial interests out of health care.,pro-medicare
So what would that mean?,pro-medicare
Here are some answers to questions about the plan.,pro-medicare
What is ‘Medicare for All’?,pro-medicare
"The Medicare for All plan from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, would create a single national health insurance plan for every American, managed and paid for by the federal government.",pro-medicare
"The plan builds on Medicare, the popular national health insurance program for Americans 65 and older and for younger people who are disabled.",pro-medicare
"The existing Medicare program would be shifted into the new system, as would all other health insurance plans.",pro-medicare
"Medicaid, the state and federal health insurance plan for low-income Americans, the Children’s Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) for low-income children, employer-sponsored health insurance, and individual health insurance plans would disappear and be replaced with the new national plan.",pro-medicare
Everyone would receive a “Universal Medicare” card.,pro-medicare
"There would be no separate health plans, managed by private insurers, such as now exists with Medicare Advantage plans.",pro-medicare
"The new system would not affect the VA or Indian Health Service, but it would eliminate TRICARE, the health care program for the military.",pro-medicare
"“The country would end up with one health system,” says Donald Berwick, president emeritus of the Boston-based nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement and a supporter of a Medicare for All approach.",pro-medicare
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, supported Sanders’s plan at first, but she has since revised her approach.",pro-medicare
"Instead, she says she would take several years to transition to Medicare for All.",pro-medicare
Is Medicare for All the same thing as single-payer or universal coverage?,pro-medicare
What about a public option?,pro-medicare
Is that the same as Medicare for All?,pro-medicare
"A public option is a health insurance plan that is funded and managed by the federal government, but would compete with private health insurance plans in the commercial market.",pro-medicare
Don’t other Democratic presidential candidates have Medicare for All plans?,pro-medicare
"Warren, Kamala Harris, D-CA, and Cory Booker, D-NJ, are co-sponsors of Sanders’s Medicare-for-All legislation, but each have different approaches, in terms of transition time and financing.",pro-medicare
"All three would allow a role for private insurers, before a time when they would transition everyone to Medicare for All.",pro-medicare
"Warren says she would push for Medicare for All before the end of her first term, while Harris and Booker have laid out longer transition times.",pro-medicare
"Other leading candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, propose adding a public option for health insurance.",pro-medicare
"Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, IN, calls his plan “Medicare for All who want it.”  Does Medicare for All mean we would give up private health insurance?",pro-medicare
"But it is possible that some health services would not be covered under a federal plan, such as cosmetic surgery, which could be covered by a private health insurer, says Berwick.",pro-medicare
What would be the benefits of Medicare for All plans?,pro-medicare
"“It would improve the generosity of health coverage,” says Charles Blahous, senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former economic adviser for President George W. Bush.",pro-medicare
Medicare for All would eliminate many of the health insurance costs we pay now.,pro-medicare
"That includes monthly premiums, copayments you make when you go to the doctor’s office or hospital, and deductibles, or the amount you pay before insurance coverage kicks in.",pro-medicare
"All Americans would have coverage for comprehensive health care services, including hospital stays; emergency room visits; doctor visits; substance use disorder treatment; dental, vision, and mental health services; long-term care; and reproductive health care.",pro-medicare
"Depending upon income, prescription drug cost sharing would be capped at $200 annually.",pro-medicare
Medicare for All would be more generous than the existing Medicare program.,pro-medicare
"Medicare requires people to pay a monthly premium for doctor visits, a deductible for hospital stays, a premium for a separate drug coverage plan, and costs for skilled nursing, such as physical therapy, after 100 days.",pro-medicare
It doesn’t pay for long-term care.,pro-medicare
"In 2016, those out-of-pocket costs, for the year, averaged $5,460 for Medicare beneficiaries, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.",pro-medicare
How much would the Medicare for All plans cost?,pro-medicare
"Estimates range from $20.5 trillion to $39 trillion or more, over 10 years in additional federal spending.",pro-medicare
"The estimates make assumptions about which years the plan would be take effect, how efficient it would be, and how much costs would be cut by the federal government taking over all health care spending.",pro-medicare
"Currently, federal, state, and local governments account for a little bit less than half of health care spending through Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and other spending.",pro-medicare
"“The projections vary depending upon assumptions about where health care provider prices would be set, how much administrative savings you could get, how much drug costs come down, and how much utilization of the health care system changes,” says Sara Collins, PhD, vice president of health care coverage and access for the Commonwealth Fund.",pro-medicare
Would it raise taxes?,pro-medicare
"Depending on your income level, yes.",pro-medicare
"To fund the plan, Sanders proposes several potential options, including a 4% tax on employees, exempting the first $29,000 for a family of four, and a 7.5% tax on employers, exempting the first $2 million in payroll.",pro-medicare
"He also proposed a tax on “extreme” wealth, increasing estate taxes, and increasing the marginal tax rate for those making more than $10 million.",pro-medicare
Warren and Harris have proposed other ways paying for it.,pro-medicare
"Warren suggested a newly calculated employer tax, a tax on billionaires, and eliminating preferential  tax rates on capital gains and dividends.",pro-medicare
"Harris has proposed higher taxes on individuals making $100,000 or more.",pro-medicare
Booker has not said how he would finance it.,pro-medicare
Sanders says Americans are already paying out-of-pocket for services.,pro-medicare
Low- and middle-income Americans would end up with more money in their pockets because they would no longer have to pay for their health care.,pro-medicare
Would Medicare for All lower health care costs?,pro-medicare
The answer depends on who is analyzing the plan.,pro-medicare
It would lower costs for people who are struggling to pay for their health care premiums and services.,pro-medicare
"In 2019, around a quarter of Americans said they had problems paying their medical bills.",pro-medicare
"One-third of insured adults said it was challenging to pay for their health insurance, and about a third said they didn’t take their medicine as prescribed because of the cost, says the Kaiser Family Foundation.",pro-medicare
"For people with employer-sponsored coverage in 2019, employees contributed an average $6,015 toward a premium for family coverage, and individuals contributed $1,242 for their premium, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.",pro-medicare
"The average deductible was $1,655, the survey says.",pro-medicare
"For people who didn’t have employer-sponsored insurance and bought individual plans, the average cost of a premium was $5,280 a year in 2018 (the most recent data available), and for family coverage, it was $14,016, according to ehealthinsurance.com.",pro-medicare
"Deductibles averaged $4,578 for individuals and $8,803 for families in 2018, the publication says.",pro-medicare
Medicare for All would eliminate these premiums and out-of-pocket costs.,pro-medicare
"It can be “thoughtfully designed to reduce total costs for a vast majority of American families,” Berwick says.",pro-medicare
"“People will get more for their money” in terms of access to more health benefits and better quality of care, he says.",pro-medicare
But it is unclear whether it would reduce the nation’s overall spending on health care services.,pro-medicare
"Medicare for All would ease the burden of paperwork on health care professionals, and reduce spending on drugs and hospital care, says Berwick.",pro-medicare
But it is hard to know if or how much these things would dampen overall spending.,pro-medicare
Others say national spending costs will increase because more people will be insured.,pro-medicare
"(In 2018, there were 27.5 million uninsured people in the U.S.) Further, the government would be expanding benefits, such as paying for long-term care, and dental, vision, and hearing services.",pro-medicare
"“The fact is, the more health services that are covered, the more it costs,” says Blahous.",pro-medicare
Would people still have a choice of doctors?,pro-medicare
"Yes, because “you won’t be restricting choice, but rather just how the health system is paid for,” says Collins.",pro-medicare
"There may be a higher demand for health providers, but she thinks the health care system could adapt.",pro-medicare
Would it mean long wait times to see doctors?,pro-medicare
"It depends on how quickly the system can adapt, and it depends on how much demand there is.",pro-medicare
"Under the Affordable Care Act, around 20 million newly insured Americans came into the health care system, but there were no reports of long waits for doctors, says Collins.",pro-medicare
How do advocates say it would improve health care?,pro-medicare
"It would create more equality in the health care system because it would eliminate the uninsured and get everyone access to health services and the drugs they need, regardless of income, say advocates.",pro-medicare
"People wouldn’t have to worry about going bankrupt to pay for an illness, and the profit motive in health care would be curbed, reducing provider and drug costs, they say.",pro-medicare
"“Millions of people will no longer have to choose between health care and other necessities like food, heat, and shelter,” Sanders says in a statement outlining his proposal.",pro-medicare
What problems do critics cite?,pro-medicare
"Fundamentally restructuring the federal government to take on trillions in additional spending would cause unpredictable disruptions to the health care system, opponents say.",pro-medicare
"Shifting financing of all health care services through a new tax on employers, employees, and high-income earners may also be a damper on the national economy and still may not be enough to pay for all the new federal spending.",pro-medicare
"“There is no realistic way to finance this,” says Blahous.",pro-medicare
"Under Sanders’s bill, experts in the federal government would also be making many decisions for patients, such as what experimental treatment options they are eligible to receive -- a role the federal government should not be playing, opponents say.",pro-medicare
"Further, hospitals and doctors may decide they no longer want to provide care when the government sets prices of services, and drug companies may no longer have the funds to invest in research and development for new treatments, they say.",pro-medicare
"Currently, hospitals and doctors accept Medicare rates but then shift costs to other private payers.",pro-medicare
They would not be able to do that under this plan.,pro-medicare
"What is certain is that Medicare for All “would be a substantial reorganization of the health system,” says Collins.",pro-medicare
Fighting for Medicare for All because health care is a human right WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW People are dying because they can’t get care.,pro-medicare
"That’s why Public Citizen has spent years advocating for an expanded and improved Medicare for All system, in which everyone in the U.S. would finally have access to the health care they need, without out-of-pocket costs or insurance companies getting between them and their doctor.",pro-medicare
"Why Some CEOs Figure ‘Medicare For All’ Is Good For Business EASTON, Pa. — Walk into a big-box retailer such as Walmart or Michaels and you’re likely to see MCS Industries’ picture frames, decorative mirrors or kitschy wall décor.",pro-medicare
"Adjacent to a dairy farm a few miles west of downtown Easton, MCS is the nation’s largest maker of such household products.",pro-medicare
But MCS doesn’t actually make anything here anymore.,pro-medicare
"It has moved its manufacturing operations to Mexico and China, with the last manufacturing jobs departing this city along the Delaware River in 2005.",pro-medicare
MCS now has about 175 U.S. employees and 600 people overseas.,pro-medicare
"“We were going to lose the business because we were no longer competitive,” CEO Richard Master explained.",pro-medicare
"And one of the biggest impediments to keeping labor costs in line, he said, has been the increasing expense of health coverage in the United States.",pro-medicare
"Today, he’s at the vanguard of a small but growing group of business executives who are lining up to support a “Medicare for All” national health program.",pro-medicare
"He argues not that health care is a human right, but that covering everyone with a government plan and decoupling health care coverage from the workplace would benefit entrepreneurship.",pro-medicare
"In February, Master stood with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) outside the Capitol after she introduced her Medicare for All bill.",pro-medicare
"“This bill removes an albatross from the neck of American business, puts more money in consumer products and will boost our economy,” he said.",pro-medicare
"As health costs continue to grow, straining employer budgets and slowing wage growth, others in the business community are beginning to take the option more seriously.",pro-medicare
"While the influential U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business lobbying groups strongly oppose increased government involvement in health care, the resolve of many in the business community — especially among smaller firms — may be shifting.",pro-medicare
"“There is growing momentum among employers supporting single-payer,” said Dan Geiger, co-director of the Business Alliance for a Healthy California, which has sought to generate business support for a universal health care program in California.",pro-medicare
About 300 mostly small employers have signed on.,pro-medicare
"“Businesses are really angry about the system, and there is a lot of frustration with its rising costs and dysfunction,” he said.",pro-medicare
Geiger acknowledged the effort still lacks support from any Fortune 500 company CEOs.,pro-medicare
He said large businesses are hesitant to get involved in this political debate and many don’t want to lose the ability to attract workers with generous health benefits.,pro-medicare
"“There is also a lingering distrust of the government, and they think they can offer coverage better than the government,” he said.",pro-medicare
"In addition, some in the business community are hesitant to sign on to Medicare for All with many details missing, such as how much it would increase taxes, said Ellen Kelsay, chief strategy officer for the National Business Group on Health, a leading business group focused on health benefits.",pro-medicare
"Democrats Propel the Debate  For decades, a government-run health plan was considered too radical an idea for serious consideration.",pro-medicare
"But Medicare for All has been garnering more political support in recent months, especially after a progressive wave helped Democrats take control of the House this year.",pro-medicare
"Several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens.",pro-medicare
"Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, strongly back it.",pro-medicare
The labor unions and consumer groups that have long endorsed a single-payer health system hope that the embrace of it by employers such as Master marks another turning point for the movement.,pro-medicare
Supporters of the concept say the health system overall would see savings from a coordinated effort to bring down prices and the elimination of many administrative costs or insurance company profits.,pro-medicare
"“It’s critical for our success to engage employers, particularly because our current system is hurting employers almost as much as it is patients,” said Melinda St. Louis, campaign director of Medicare for All at Public Citizen, a consumer-rights group based in Washington.",pro-medicare
"Master, a former Washington lawyer, worked on Democratic Sen. George McGovern’s presidential campaign before returning to Pennsylvania in 1973 to take over his father’s company, which made rigid paper boxes.",pro-medicare
"In 1980, he founded MCS, which pioneered the popular front-loading picture frame and steamless fog-free mirrors for bathrooms.",pro-medicare
The company has grown into a $250 million corporation.,pro-medicare
Master frequently travels to Washington and around the country to talk to business leaders as he seeks to build political support for a single-payer health system.,pro-medicare
"In the past four years, he has produced several documentary videos on the topic.",pro-medicare
"In 2018, he formed the Business Initiative for Health Policy, a nonprofit group of business leaders, economists and health policy experts trying to explain the financial benefits of a single-payer system.",pro-medicare
"Dan Wolf, CEO of Cape Air, a Hyannis, Mass.-based regional airline that employs 800 people calls himself “a free market guy.” But he also supports Medicare for All.",pro-medicare
He said Master helps turn the political argument over single-payer into a practical one.,pro-medicare
"“It’s about good business sense and about caring for his employees and their well-being,” he said, adding that employers should no longer be straddled with the cost and complexity of health care.",pro-medicare
"“It makes no more sense for an airline to understand health policy for the bulk of its workers than for a health facility to have to supply all the air transportation for its employees,” he said.",pro-medicare
"Employers are also an important voice in the debate because 156 million Americans get employer-paid health care, making it by far the single-largest form of coverage.",pro-medicare
"Master said his company has tried various methods to control costs with little success, including high deductibles, narrow networks of providers and wellness plans that emphasize preventive medicine.",pro-medicare
"Insurers who are supposed to negotiate lower rates from hospitals and doctors have failed, he added, and too many premium dollars go to covering administrative costs.",pro-medicare
"Only by having the federal government set rates can the United States control costs of drugs, hospitals and other health services, he said.",pro-medicare
"“Insurance companies are not watching the store and don’t have incentives to hold down costs in the current system,” he said.",pro-medicare
"Glad The Boss Is Trying To Make A Difference  What’s left of MCS in Pennsylvania is a spacious corporate office building housing administrative staff, designers and a giant distribution center piled high with carton boxes from floor to ceiling.",pro-medicare
"MCS pays an average of $1,260 per month for each employee’s health care, up from $716 in 2009, the company said.",pro-medicare
"In recent years, the company has reduced out-of-pocket costs for employees by covering most of their deductibles.",pro-medicare
"Medicare for All would require several new taxes to raise money, but Master said such a plan would mean savings for his company and employees.",pro-medicare
"MCS employees largely support Master’s attempt to fix the health system even if they are not all on board with a Medicare for All approach, according to interviews with several workers in Easton.",pro-medicare
"“I think it’s a good idea,” said Faith Wildrick, a shipper at MCS who has worked for the company 26 years.",pro-medicare
"“If the other countries are doing it and it is working for them, why can’t it work for us?”  Wildrick said that even with insurance her family struggles with health costs as her husband, Bill, a former MCS employee, deals with liver disease and needs many diagnostic tests and prescription medications.",pro-medicare
"Their annual deductible has swung from $4,000 several years ago to $500 this year as the company has worked to lower employees’ out-of-pocket costs.",pro-medicare
"“I’m really glad someone is fighting for this and trying to make a difference,” said Wildrick.",pro-medicare
"Jessica Ehrhardt, the human resources manager at MCS, said the effort to reduce employees’ out-of-pocket health costs means the company must pay higher health costs.",pro-medicare
"That results in less money for salary increases and other benefits, she added.",pro-medicare
"Asked about Medicare for All, Ehrhardt said, “It’s a drastic solution, but something needs to happen.”  For too long, Master said, the push for a single-payer health system has been about ideology.",pro-medicare
"“The movement has been about making health care a human right and that we have a right to universal health care,” he said.",pro-medicare
“What I am saying is this is prudent for our economy and am trying to make the business and economic case.”,pro-medicare
"The “Strongest Argument Against Medicare for All” Is Very, Very Weak I make a living teaching students how to construct arguments and analyze arguments made by others.",pro-medicare
I wrote a book about logic.,pro-medicare
I love this stuff.,pro-medicare
"So when I see a New York Times opinion piece titled “This Is the Strongest Argument Against Medicare for All,” my ears perk up.",pro-medicare
"The author, Reason magazine features editor Peter Suderman, tells the story of Vermont’s brief flirtation with the possibility of passing a state-level program similar in certain respects to Bernie Sanders’s federal Medicare for All proposal.",pro-medicare
"According to Suderman, the effort failed, and this “failure” shows “why any similar project undertaken at a national scale is unlikely to succeed as well.”  There are two central problems with the claim that Vermont “tried” and “failed” to implement a “single-payer” health insurance plan.",pro-medicare
The first is that the proposal being considered in Vermont wasn’t a single-payer plan.,pro-medicare
The second is that it was never tried.,pro-medicare
"A single-payer system is one in which, even if private plans exist to provide supplemental health care, only one entity is paying for basic care.",pro-medicare
A system in which private plans compete with a public one to pay for such care is by definition multi-payer — and any version of the health reform being considered in Vermont would have fallen into the latter category.,pro-medicare
"Vermont probably couldn’t legally get away with trying to interfere with interstate commerce by banning private health insurance companies from doing business in the state, and in any case, their state legislature was never going to try.",pro-medicare
The bill they did pass to “investigate” the possibility of single payer also established (as required by the Affordable Care Act) an exchange for Vermonters to buy into private plans.,pro-medicare
This isn’t semantic hairsplitting.,pro-medicare
Some crucial advantages of single-payer systems rely on the state having a monopoly on basic health insurance.,pro-medicare
Take cost control.,pro-medicare
Many doctors currently refuse to take Medicaid because it pays out at a lower rate than private plans.,pro-medicare
"If Vermont’s proposed public plan, Green Mountain Care, had come into existence, either it would have faced the same problem, or lawmakers would have had to continue to jack up the payout rates in a budget-busting attempt to compete with private plans.",pro-medicare
"If Bernie’s plan to abolish private plans (at least for basic insurance) were implemented, on the other hand, doctors and hospitals would have to either close their doors or make do with the rate that Medicare was willing to pay.",pro-medicare
The last several decades of Canadian history strongly suggest that most of them would learn to make do.,pro-medicare
"One of the logical fallacies I teach students in my critical thinking classes is the “fallacy of equivocation,” which is committed by arguments like this one:  Premise One: Only men are rational.",pro-medicare
Premise Two: Women are not men.,pro-medicare
Conclusion: Women are not rational.,pro-medicare
"On a syntactic level, this looks like a valid argument.",pro-medicare
"The problem, of course, is that “men” is being used to mean “humans” in the first premise and “male humans” in the second premise.",pro-medicare
"Similarly, Suderman’s argument seems to be something like this:  Premise One: Former governor Peter Shumlin tried and failed to implement single payer in Vermont.",pro-medicare
Premise Two: ???,pro-medicare
Conclusion: A President Bernie Sanders would fail if he tried to implement single payer on a national scale.,pro-medicare
"As we’ve seen, “single payer” means something different in the first premise and in the conclusion.",pro-medicare
"In the premise, it means “a multi-payer system with a public option” — i.e.",pro-medicare
"the sort of thing that candidates like Joe Biden, Julian Castro, and Pete Buttigieg have proposed.",pro-medicare
"More importantly, though, Suderman’s argument relies on a second equivocation.",pro-medicare
Governor Shumlin didn’t try and fail to get the legislature to sign off on the creation of Green Mountain Care.,pro-medicare
Nor was there some initial implementation of the program that ended in disaster.,pro-medicare
"What happened was, quite simply, that Governor Shumlin got cold feet.",pro-medicare
Suderman tells us that Shumlin decided not to go ahead with the plan for Green Mountain Care because it would have involved unacceptably high tax rates.,pro-medicare
"Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, has always been comfortable telling voters and journalists that his Medicare for All plan would involve a tax increase for middle-income taxpayers.",pro-medicare
"He’s emphasized, however, that the combination of this modest increase with the abolition of premiums, co-pays, and deductibles would mean considerable overall savings for those same taxpayers.",pro-medicare
It’s hard to imagine Bernie Sanders simply deciding not to push for Medicare for All legislation after being elected president.,pro-medicare
"If this isn’t what Suderman means to suggest, however, his central premise is irrelevant to his conclusion.",pro-medicare
"On the other hand, if he wants to suggest that single payer would “fail” in any other sense, all his work is still ahead of him.",pro-medicare
"No one denies that a hypothetical President Sanders who used every available bit of political capital to push for single payer, instead of Shumlin-ing out, would face a steep uphill climb to make it happen.",pro-medicare
"(No one is more aware of this problem than Sanders himself, who has been talking for years about the need for a grassroots “political revolution” to make his political agenda a reality.)",pro-medicare
"Once such a program were in place, though, an abundance of evidence from several countries around the world strongly suggests that it would succeed in every sense.",pro-medicare
"Suderman describes the inference he tries to draw from Shumlin’s cold feet as “the strongest argument against Mr. Sanders’s single-player plan.” As a defender of Sanders’s plan, I hope he’s right.",pro-medicare
"If this is the best argument the other side has to offer, they’ve lost the debate.",pro-medicare
Stop fearmongering about 'Medicare for All.',pro-medicare
Most families would pay less for better care.,pro-medicare
The case for Medicare for All is simple.,pro-medicare
"It would cover everyone, period.",pro-medicare
"Done right, it would lower costs.",pro-medicare
And it would ease paperwork and confusion.,pro-medicare
"With costs rising painfully, insurance companies denying care and nearly 30 million people still uninsured, America desperately needs an honest health policy discussion.",pro-medicare
"That’s why it has been so disappointing over the past several weeks to watch multiple candidates parrot right-wing attacks on ""Medicare for All,"" like claiming that it will greatly increase spending on health care or ringing alarms about raising taxes on the middle class.",pro-medicare
The truth is the opposite: Medicare for All would sharply reduce overall spending on health care.,pro-medicare
"It can be thoughtfully designed to reduce total costs for the vast majority of American families, while improving the quality of the care they get.",pro-medicare
"Over my career, I have witnessed the problems with our health care system firsthand.",pro-medicare
"As a pediatrician, I have seen how our fragmented, expensive system hurts children and families.",pro-medicare
"As a researcher at Harvard Medical School, I have studied the causes of waste and overspending in our system.",pro-medicare
"And as President Barack Obama’s head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, I led the existing Medicare system and helped stand up Obamacare.",pro-medicare
Best fix for a patchwork health system  What I saw convinced me that the Affordable Care Act was an essential step forward.,pro-medicare
"But covering all Americans through a single-payer, federal insurance program would now be a wiser path.",pro-medicare
"President Obama has said it himself: It is now time for ""good new ideas like Medicare for All.""",pro-medicare
The case for Medicare for All is simple.,pro-medicare
It would cover everyone — period.,pro-medicare
"Done right, it would lower costs, a lot, while letting us leverage health care dollars to respond to public health crises like the opioid epidemic, invest in disease prevention and modernize care delivery with telemedicine.",pro-medicare
"And it would be simpler, easing the onerous burdens of billing for doctors, endless paperwork for all health care professionals, and navigating the confusing coverage system for patients and families.",pro-medicare
"Compared with some candidates’ plans that retain our patchwork of coverage, Medicare for All wins twice: on both simplicity and savings.",pro-medicare
Some candidates have attempted to sidestep the cost debate by promising to spend less and accomplish the same goals.,pro-medicare
"These proposals, such as relying on a public option or expanding Medicare Advantage, offering private plans within Medicare, provide too few details to allow real cost comparisons.",pro-medicare
But it is unlikely they will do as much as Medicare for All would to reduce national health care spending or reduce costs for families.,pro-medicare
"Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested as much when she claimed in the latest Democratic presidential debate that one alternative proposal, “Medicare for All Who Want It,” would really mean “Medicare for All Who Can Afford It.” The reasons are simple.",pro-medicare
"First, these alternative plans retain a costly architecture of private profits and payment complexity.",pro-medicare
"And second, they don’t have the scale of Medicare for All, which is crucial for simplifying billing, improving the quality and safety of care, and removing wasteful spending.",pro-medicare
"Nearly certain to save trillions Faced with these facts, opponents of Medicare for All too often revert to myths instead.",pro-medicare
The first myth is that Medicare for All will necessarily increase health care spending.,pro-medicare
That’s wrong.,pro-medicare
"The fact is that, without a change, Americans will spend over $45 trillion on health care in the next 10 years.",pro-medicare
"Under Medicare for All, total health care spending would likely be far lower.",pro-medicare
"The cost would depend on many implementation decisions that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ bill, for example, leaves open for thoughtful exploration, careful choice and adjustments over time: payment rates to hospitals and doctors, content of the benefit package, details of price negotiations with drug companies, design of simplified administration and more.",pro-medicare
The costs are largely under our control; they will depend on how we design the new system.,pro-medicare
"If we made wise choices, I regard it as nearly certain that Medicare for All would save trillions of dollars over the decade compared with our projected health care spending.",pro-medicare
The second myth is that is Medicare for All must raise taxes on middle-class families.,pro-medicare
That is misleading.,pro-medicare
"Medicare for All’s cost to families, no matter how it is funded, should be compared with what those same American families will spend on health care if we do nothing.",pro-medicare
"And as things stand now, the trajectory of their health care spending is looking increasingly painful.",pro-medicare
"Sanders at last week's debate railed against “defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel,"" one that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured or underinsured, and contributes to tens of thousands of deaths and bankruptcies each year.",pro-medicare
"Health care costs are crushing the middle class, taking more and more money straight from the wallets of workers and families.",pro-medicare
"Small businesses simply cannot afford coverage anymore, and governments at all levels know that uncontrolled health care costs crowd out other priorities, like roads, schools and the social safety net.",pro-medicare
Every “Made in America” product has these sky-high costs built into its price.,pro-medicare
"The average premium for a family of four in 2019 is a staggering $20,576 — a toll that is eating into their wages, while their out-of-pocket costs soar.",pro-medicare
"Since 2009, premiums have increased 54% and workers’ contributions to premiums have increased 71%, but wages have risen only 26%.",pro-medicare
"A shift in family costs, not an increase  Framing this debate by fearmongering over “higher taxes” ignores that this money is already coming out of American families’ pockets.",pro-medicare
"Right now, these costs actually amount to a regressive tax that every family pays no matter whether their wage-earner is a CEO or a secretary.",pro-medicare
We can discuss whether a Medicare for All program that uses our money to fund Medicare instead of financing private insurance companies is a good idea.,pro-medicare
But it is deeply misleading to pretend that this shift is an increase in family health care costs.,pro-medicare
And no one should buy the myth that Medicare for All represents a “government takeover of health care.” It does not.,pro-medicare
"Medicare for All is about paying for care, not providing it.",pro-medicare
Not one proposal suggests that health care delivery should become a government function (beyond existing forms like the Veterans Health Administration).,pro-medicare
"It offers Americans, at last, a simple way to assure that they have the coverage they need to see the doctors they want and use the hospitals they choose.",pro-medicare
"Almost all doctors and hospitals would be in Medicare’s network, and no patients would have to check their insurance card to find out whom they can see and at what cost out of pocket.",pro-medicare
The country deserves a real debate about health care — not one that misleads Americans about how public financing of health care would affect them.,pro-medicare
"A real debate would show that Medicare for All, though not a perfect solution, is the best option we have to get health care costs and quality back on track, lifting an exhausting burden off American families and businesses.",pro-medicare

"But if it were harder to buy guns, they would also stay out of the hands of irresponsible men and women, whose negligent treatment of their weapons results in a great number of deaths and injuries every year, many of which involve children.",anti-guns

"In exchange for that pat emotional comfort, thousands upon thousands of Americans will continue to die unnecessarily.",anti-guns
Or we can agree that the only way to prevent gun violence and gun deaths is to regulate guns; sacrificing the illusion that a gun equals freedom is probably worth it.,anti-guns
The question of what sensible gun legislation looks like is one that politicians still need to hash out.,anti-guns

It’s Time to Ban Guns.,anti-guns
"Yes, All of Them.",anti-guns
"By PHOEBE MALTZ BOVY December 10, 2015Add to Pocket Ban guns.",anti-guns
"Get rid of guns in homes, and on the streets, and, as much as possible, on police.",anti-guns
"Not just because of San Bernardino, or whichever mass shooting may pop up next, but also not not because of those.",anti-guns
Don’t sort the population into those who might do something evil or foolish or self-destructive with a gun and those who surely will not.,anti-guns
As if this could be known—as if it could be assessed without massively violating civil liberties and stigmatizing the mentally ill. Ban guns!,anti-guns
Not just gun violence.,anti-guns
Not just certain guns.,anti-guns
Not just already-technically-illegal guns.,anti-guns
All of them.,anti-guns
I used to refer to my position on this issue as being in favor of gun control.,anti-guns
"Which is true, except that “gun control” at its most radical still tends to refer to bans on certain weapons and closing loopholes.",anti-guns
"The recent New York Times front-page editorial, as much as it infuriated some, was still too tentative.",anti-guns
"“Certain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in California, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian ownership,” the paper argued, making the case for “reasonable regulation,” nothing more.",anti-guns
Even the rare ban-guns arguments involve prefacing and hedging and disclaimers.,anti-guns
"“We shouldn’t ‘take them away’ from people who currently own them, necessarily,” writes Hollis Phelps in Salon.",anti-guns
"Oh, but we should.",anti-guns
"I say this not to win some sort of ideological purity contest, but because banning guns urgently needs to become a rhetorical and conceptual possibility.",anti-guns
"The national conversation needs to shift from one extreme—an acceptance, ranging from complacent to enthusiastic, of an individual right to own guns—to another, which requires people who are not politicians to speak their minds.",anti-guns
And this will only happen if the Americans who are quietly convinced that guns are terrible speak out.,anti-guns
"Their wariness, as far as I can tell, comes from two issues: a readiness to accept the Second Amendment as a refutation, and a reluctance to impose “elite” culture on parts of the country where guns are popular.",anti-guns
"(There are other reasons as well, not least a fear of getting shot.)",anti-guns
"And there’s the extent to which it’s just so ingrained that banning guns is impossible, legislatively and pragmatically, which dramatically weakens the anti-gun position.",anti-guns
The first issue shouldn’t be so complicated.,anti-guns
It doesn’t take specialized expertise in constitutional law to understand that current U.S. gun law gets its parameters from Supreme Court interpretations of the Second Amendment.,anti-guns
But it’s right there in the First Amendment that we don’t have to simply nod along with what follows.,anti-guns
"That the Second Amendment has been liberally interpreted doesn’t prevent any of us from saying it’s been misinterpreted, or that it should be repealed.",anti-guns
"When you find yourself assuming that everyone who has a more nuanced (or just pro-gun) argument is simply better read on the topic, remember that opponents of abortion aren’t wondering whether they should have a more nuanced view of  abortion because of Roe v. Wade.",anti-guns

"If you grew up somewhere in America where gun culture wasn’t a thing (as is my situation; I’m an American living in Canada), or even just in a family that would have never considered gun ownership, you’ll probably be accused of looking down your nose at gun culture.",anti-guns
"As if gun ownership were simply a cultural tradition to be respected, and not, you know, about owning guns.",anti-guns
"Guns… I mean, must it really be spelled out what’s different?",anti-guns
It’s absurd to reduce an anti-gun position to a snooty aesthetic preference.,anti-guns
"There’s also a more progressive version of this argument, and a more contrarian one, which involves suggesting that an anti-gun position is racist, because crackdowns on guns are criminal-justice interventions.",anti-guns
Progressives who might have been able to brush off accusations of anti-rural-white classism may have a tougher time confronting arguments about the disparate impact gun control policies can have on marginalized communities.,anti-guns
"These, however, are criticisms of certain tentative, insufficient gun control measures—the ones that would leave small-town white families with legally-acquired guns well enough alone, allowing them to shoot themselves or one another and to let their guns enter the general population.",anti-guns
"Ban Guns, meanwhile, is not discriminatory in this way.",anti-guns
It’s not about dividing society into “good” and “bad” gun owners.,anti-guns
It’s about placing gun ownership itself in the “bad” category.,anti-guns
"It’s worth adding that the anti-gun position is ultimately about police not carrying guns, either.",anti-guns

"Well, certainly not if we keep on insisting on its impossibility.",anti-guns
Ask yourself this: Is the pro-gun side concerned with how it comes across?,anti-guns
"More to the point: Does the fact that someone opposes gun control demonstrate that they’re culturally sensitive to the concerns of small-town whites, as well as deeply committed to fighting police brutality against blacks nationwide?",anti-guns
I’m going to go with no and no on these.,anti-guns
(The NRA exists!),anti-guns
"On the pro-gun-control side of things, there’s far too much timidity.",anti-guns

Public opinion needs to shift.,anti-guns
"The no-guns stance needs to be an identifiable place on the spectrum, embraced unapologetically, if it’s to be reckoned with.",anti-guns
The research is clear: gun control saves lives.,anti-guns
It’s certainly an eye-catching headline: “I used to think gun control was the answer.,anti-guns
"My research told me otherwise.” And after the Las Vegas mass shooting on Sunday, it went viral: As of Wednesday afternoon, it had thousands of shares on social media, and more than 5,000 comments on the Washington Post page.",anti-guns
"But despite the article’s headline and author Leah Libresco’s data journalism credentials, the column is surprisingly thin on studies and data.",anti-guns
"In fact, it cites no specific studies on gun control whatsoever.",anti-guns
Here’s what seems to be the most evidence-based claim in the piece:  I researched the strictly tightened gun laws in Britain and Australia and concluded that they didn’t prove much about what America’s policy should be.,anti-guns
Neither nation experienced drops in mass shootings or other gun related-crime that could be attributed to their buybacks and bans.,anti-guns
Mass shootings were too rare in Australia for their absence after the buyback program to be clear evidence of progress.,anti-guns
"And in both Australia and Britain, the gun restrictions had an ambiguous effect on other gun-related crimes or deaths.",anti-guns
That’s … it.,anti-guns
"The original article at FiveThirtyEight, which Libresco again pointed me to in an email for her main source of data, cites a couple of real studies, but it only cherry-picked the more negative findings in the field.",anti-guns
"(Even then, one study cited found that Australia’s 1996 gun control law and buyback program was followed by a faster drop in gun deaths than would otherwise be expected; it’s just unclear whether the policy was the main cause.)",anti-guns
"The rest of the article makes no attempt to raise any other actual empirical research, only citing a few statistics about the demographics of gun deaths.",anti-guns
"That’s unfortunate, because there actually is a rich and growing body of evidence on guns.",anti-guns
"It’s not perfect by any means — this is a tough issue to study, for reasons I’ll get into below.",anti-guns
But it’s fairly persuasive.,anti-guns
"In fact, it’s so persuasive that it changed my mind.",anti-guns
I was once skeptical of gun control; I doubted it would have any major impact on gun deaths (similar to the views I took on drugs).,anti-guns
Then I looked at the actual empirical research and studies.,anti-guns
"My conclusion: Gun control likely saves lives, even if it won’t and can’t prevent all gun deaths.",anti-guns
"America’s affair with guns is unique in the developed world To understand this issue, there’s one thing you need to know: America stands alone when it comes to guns.",anti-guns
"Not only does the US have more guns than any other country in the world, it also has far more gun deaths than any other developed nation.",anti-guns
"The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian.",anti-guns
"(These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)",anti-guns
The US also has by far the highest number of guns in the world.,anti-guns
"Estimated in 2007, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 88.8 guns per 100 people, meaning there was almost one privately owned gun per American and more than one per American adult.",anti-guns
"The world's second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 54.8 guns per 100 people.",anti-guns
"In short, America has the most gun deaths in the developed world, and the most guns period.",anti-guns
"What’s more, the research indicates these two issues are very much related.",anti-guns
"The research is very clear: more guns mean more gun deaths Going back to the Washington Post op-ed, Libresco argues that her research proved her initial bias — that gun control works — wrong.",anti-guns
But there have been much more thorough statistical analyses than what Libresco published at FiveThirtyEight or wrote about in the Washington Post.,anti-guns
They all point to one fact: Gun control does work to save lives.,anti-guns
"Last year, researchers from around the country reviewed more than 130 studies from 10 countries on gun control for Epidemiologic Reviews.",anti-guns
"This is, for now, the most current, extensive review of the research on the effects of gun control.",anti-guns
"The findings were clear: “The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths.”  The study did not look at one specific intervention, but rather a variety of kinds of gun control, from licensing measures to buyback programs.",anti-guns
"Time and time again, they found the same line of evidence: Reducing access to guns was followed by a drop in deaths related to guns.",anti-guns
"And while non-gun homicides also decreased, the drop wasn’t as quick as the one seen in gun-related homicides — indicating that access to guns was a potential causal factor.",anti-guns
"Based on the other research, this actually isn’t a very surprising finding.",anti-guns
"Regularly updated reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center have consistently found that when controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths.",anti-guns
"“Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health.",anti-guns
"For example, this chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, shows a correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates:  A chart that shows the close correlation between levels of gun ownership and gun homicide rates.",anti-guns
"Social Science and Medicine A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.",anti-guns
This holds up around the world.,anti-guns
"As Zack Beauchamp explained for Vox, a breakthrough analysis in the 1990s by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations.",anti-guns
"Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.",anti-guns
"“A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote.",anti-guns
“A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.”  So America’s easy access to guns seems to lead to more gun violence and death.,anti-guns
"But let’s focus on Australia and the UK in particular, since that’s what Libresco did in her Washington Post piece.",anti-guns
It is true that this is a difficult area to study.,anti-guns
"In part, that’s because these countries have such low homicide rates — to some degree because of previously existing, stricter gun control, criminal justice researcher Jerry Ratcliffe pointed out — that it’s going to be difficult to produce any statistically significant findings.",anti-guns
"It’s also difficult to wash out external effects, besides gun control, on gun deaths, even under the most statistically rigorous models.",anti-guns
"The evidence from Australia in particular, though, is very suggestive.",anti-guns
"In her article for FiveThirtyEight, Libresco cited two studies — one from 2003 and another from 2016 — that found what she described as little evidence of the effectiveness of gun control.",anti-guns
This seems to be true for the 2003 analysis.,anti-guns
"But the 2016 analysis is much more mixed, noting that there were faster drops in gun deaths after the buyback program was put in place, but failed to reach any hard conclusions because non-gun deaths also dropped more quickly (even more than gun deaths), suggesting that other variables were likely involved.",anti-guns
But this isn’t the only research into Australia’s laws.,anti-guns
"As my colleagues Dylan Matthews and Zack Beauchamp noted, other studies found positive impacts of the law.",anti-guns
"A review of the evidence by Harvard’s David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis, for one, concluded that Australia’s law “seems to have been incredibly successful in terms of lives saved.”  A 2010 study by Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University also found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides.",anti-guns
"The drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant, largely because the country’s gun homicide rate is so low that it’s hard to tease out even sharp drops with a lot of certainty.",anti-guns
But the drop in suicides was statistically significant.,anti-guns
"Most tellingly, Leigh and Neill’s study found that “the largest falls in firearm deaths occurred in states where more firearms were bought back.” Hemenway and Vriniotis reached similar conclusions in their review: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback.",anti-guns
"Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.”  By homing in on individual states and types of guns, these studies provide a more rigorous and robust look at Australia’s law than a study like the 2016 analysis that Libresco cited, which broadly looked at nationwide data.",anti-guns
"And they conclude that the buyback program, along with other changes brought on by the 1996 law, reduced gun deaths.",anti-guns
"But most importantly, this goes along with the rest of the evidence — including the extensive review published in Epidemiologic Reviews.",anti-guns
"When you put it all together, it’s hard to come to any conclusion other than gun control does, at least to some extent, reduce gun deaths.",anti-guns
Gun control can’t stop all violence.,anti-guns
But it can help.,anti-guns
"With that said, it's probably true that this aspect of the gun control debate is not emphasized enough: Guns are a factor, not the only factor.",anti-guns
"Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.",anti-guns
"But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America's high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers — and stricter access to guns could help.",anti-guns
"Another issue is that many of the policies researchers have studied seem to have, politically speaking, little to no chance in the US, at least at the federal level.",anti-guns
"Australia outright banned some types of guns, and set up a registry for all firearms owned in the country, required a permit for all new purchases.",anti-guns
"And, as if that wasn’t enough, its buyback program was mandatory — meaning you had to turn in your weapons, which is essentially government-mandated confiscation.",anti-guns
America can’t even get universal background checks through Congress.,anti-guns
These much stricter measures have almost no chance of happening.,anti-guns
"That hinders the potential effectiveness of US laws: As Dylan Matthews explained, milder versions of gun control do have some evidence behind them in terms of reducing gun deaths, but they’re nowhere as strong as the effects seen with stricter policies.",anti-guns
"It’s also true, as Libresco said on Twitter, that we could always use more research into gun policy (or, really, any policy issue).",anti-guns
But the federal government has stifled gun research for years.,anti-guns
"Still, the current research is clear: Gun control does cut down on gun deaths.",anti-guns
A single data journalist’s look at some of the evidence doesn’t change that fact.,anti-guns
America is turning against guns.,anti-guns
"Like a director yelling “action,” the horrific mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, last weekend cued all the same political actors to repeat all the same political lines.",anti-guns
Conservatives offered their prayers and talked about mental health and video games; progressives decried inaction in Washington.,anti-guns
Voters could be forgiven for assuming they have seen this play before and nothing will ever change.,anti-guns
But this is wrong.,anti-guns
"America’s relationship with guns is changing, and people, more than ever, want someone to “do something.” These new attitudes will transcend the red/blue divide and provide a litmus test of our political leaders’ values.",anti-guns
Republicans increasingly understand that they are on the wrong side of history and risk political ruin in the suburbs if they do not find a way to distance themselves from perceived complacency.,anti-guns
It hasn’t always been this way.,anti-guns
"After losing the 2000 presidential election, Democrats took stock.",anti-guns
"They looked at states like West Virginia, Ohio and Missouri and grew concerned about a growing cultural disconnect between the party and the people in the interior of the country.",anti-guns
"Democrats made a tactical decision to walk away from “gun control.” In 2004, the assault weapons ban was allowed to expire without protest from congressional Democrats.",anti-guns
The party recruited pro-gun candidates to run in rural districts in the 2006 midterms.,anti-guns
Barack Obama did not make gun control a major theme in either of his national campaigns.,anti-guns
"After Sandy Hook, Obama introduced executive orders addressing guns and championed Manchin-Toomey, a bipartisan bill that would have expanded background checks, but it was defeated by Senate Republicans and a handful of Senate Democrats representing red states.",anti-guns
"Today, the Democratic presidential candidates have made reducing gun violence a major campaign issue.",anti-guns
"They all embrace some kind of ban on assault weapons, and some proposals are bold, such as Cory Booker’s plan for federal licensing and Joe Biden’s national buy-back program.",anti-guns
Rep. Eric Swalwell made guns his central and defining issue before he dropped out last month.,anti-guns
"Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former National Rifle Association member, felt compelled, after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, to donate $20,000 he had received in NRA political contributions to gun violence prevention groups.",anti-guns
"The new Democratic House passed a bill in February requiring a background check on every firearm sale that would represent the most significant gun legislation since 1994, if passed by the Senate.",anti-guns
"In the face of inaction in Washington and a hostile Supreme Court, a revitalized gun-control movement (including groups like Giffords, Moms Demand Action and Everytown) and political leaders have pushed for legislation at the state level and have passed ballot initiatives with gun restrictions in states across the nation.",anti-guns
Democrats and advocates are not simply appealing to a progressive base but are reflecting a profound change in America’s relationship with guns.,anti-guns
"While there is some dispute about the numbers, both the General Social Survey and the Pew Research Center report a decline in gun ownership in this country.",anti-guns
"As important, these guns are concentrated in fewer hands.",anti-guns
"While Americans own more than 260 million civilian guns, according to a 2015 Harvard and Northeastern University study, 3 percent of the population owns half of those guns.",anti-guns
"This reflects the decline of hunting as a sport and cultural pastime, as the country comes less rural and the population more diverse.",anti-guns
"Now a narrower group of people owns guns, and they are more likely to say they have them for self-protection (60 percent cite personal safety vs. 36 percent who hunt, according to a 2013 Gallup poll).",anti-guns
"At the same time, voters’ views on this issue are changing.",anti-guns
"Even before the shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Gallup recorded the highest level of support for stricter gun laws in 25 years.",anti-guns
The share of voters very dissatisfied with the nation’s gun laws has nearly doubled from 2008 (21 percent) to 2019 (40 percent).,anti-guns
"While the NRA tears itself apart over accusations of mismanagement and questions about its strategy, national polling shows that the organization gets net-negative ratings for the first time in two decades.",anti-guns
"In a recent GQR survey of 2,000 likely 2020 voters, more than 1 in 4 say their views on guns have changed within the past five years.",anti-guns
"This number includes 1 in 3 Democrats, but also 1 in 4 independents and 1 in 5 Republicans.",anti-guns
"Among these voters, 78 percent — and 70 percent of Republicans — have moved toward supporting stronger gun laws.",anti-guns
"The primary reasons for this change: Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Orlando, Las Vegas, Aurora, Columbine, Parkland, Sutherland Springs, Charleston, and now El Paso and Dayton.",anti-guns
"In our survey, we asked those whose views on guns are evolving to describe what specifically changed their minds.",anti-guns
"Among voters moving toward stronger gun laws, 55 percent volunteered either mass shootings or school shootings, and 16 percent talked about easy access to guns.",anti-guns
American voters now broadly support efforts to reduce gun violence.,anti-guns
A May Quinnipiac poll found that 94 percent of voters favored universal background checks.,anti-guns
"A strong majority also favor an assault weapon ban: In the GQR survey, a 65 percent majority backed a ban on assault weapons, including 52 percent of Republicans and a 55 percent in gun-owning households.",anti-guns
"Earlier in the decade, surveys tracked support in the low to mid 50s, but now most survey show support above 60 percent.",anti-guns
"Importantly, a 65 percent majority also believed that mass shootings are often caused by easy access to assault weapons.",anti-guns
"An even more impressive 72 percent supported a buyback program for assault weapons, like the one instituted in Australia after a 1996 mass shooting there.",anti-guns
Gun control has real political traction.,anti-guns
Gallup shows that the share of voters who count the issue as a major factor in their electoral decision-making is increasing.,anti-guns
"In the GQR survey, 19 percent listed “reducing gun violence” as one of the most important issues facing the country, below health care (33 percent) and immigration (28 percent), but essentially tied with the economy and jobs (21 percent) and keeping taxes and spending down (20 percent).",anti-guns
"Among African Americans, this is the second most important issue, behind only reducing the cost of health care.",anti-guns
"It’s even more intense among younger people, whose turnout increased dramatically in the 2018 mid-term elections.",anti-guns
"A Harvard Institute of Politics study showed that concerns about school shootings, health care and gun violence were the first, second and third issues most correlated with the likelihood of voting.",anti-guns
"(Conversely, a 2014 Quinnipiac survey showed just 3 percent identifying gun policy as one of their most important issues.)",anti-guns
"Despite these changes, there is still a real and visceral attachment to gun ownership.",anti-guns
"Not surprisingly, since more people own guns for “protection,” nearly 60 percent in the GQR survey said having a gun makes you safer.",anti-guns
"Gallup research suggests this is a reversal from the past, when a majority of people thought having a gun in the house made it a more dangerous place.",anti-guns
People also have doubts about the effectiveness of restrictions on guns.,anti-guns
"In the GQR survey, for example, 83 percent believed that criminals will get guns regardless of what the law says.",anti-guns
"Still, people seem comfortable with these tensions, as 84 percent also said that while no law can prevent all mass shootings, “we can make them less frequent.” As we have heard in focus groups, including among gun owners, people just want to “do something,” even if it doesn’t completely solve the problem.",anti-guns
They do not want mass shootings to be America’s “new normal.” The fact that people support stronger gun laws — even if some criminals continue to obtain guns and no law can stop all mass shootings — is a critical advance for this movement.,anti-guns
Advocates of reducing gun violence still face political obstacles.,anti-guns
"When Democrats retreated from the issue after the 2000 election, the gun lobby did not regard that as a truce.",anti-guns
"It exploited a largely uncontested field to advance its positions, and guns became deeply tied to the views of the GOP base.",anti-guns
"Rural red states have huge power in the Senate to prevent meaningful change (Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s tweet calling for “bipartisan, bicameral” efforts rings hollow), and President Trump, in his remarks to the nation after El Paso and Dayton, did not support any new restrictions on access to guns.",anti-guns
"Still, the cracks are showing.",anti-guns
"After the Parkland shooting last year, Florida Gov.",anti-guns
Rick Scott (R) signed legislation that raised the age for gun purchases and instituted a three-day waiting period (which the NRA immediately challenged in court).,anti-guns
"This past week, Republican Gov.",anti-guns
"Mike DeWine of Ohio proposed a 17-point plan to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks, protective orders to take firearms away from potentially dangerous individuals and increased penalties on a range of illegal gun activities.",anti-guns
"Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican who represents Dayton in Congress and has a 93 percent rating from the NRA, called Tuesday for an assault weapons ban.",anti-guns
"“The carnage these military style weapons are able to produce when available to the wrong people is intolerable,” he said in a statement.",anti-guns
"“ … This tragedy must become a catalyst for a broader national conversation about what we can do to stop these mass shootings.”  For the people used to offering them, thoughts and prayers are no longer enough.",anti-guns
"We Need Gun Control at Every Level The vast majority of Americans do not need a firearm, and yet they own them anyway, and continue to use them to kill.",anti-guns
"This is an epidemic that stems from a single source—the enormous, poorly regulated market for arms, propped up by an obscenely rich political lobby holding half of America’s electoral politics hostage.",anti-guns
"This is the starting point; the argument over whether or not we need more or less gun control is, to me, as useless as debating whether or not fossil fuels are poisoning the air.",anti-guns
Nearly all credible research shows that we need fewer guns and better accountability and regulations for the ones we keep; the only thing left for us to do is haggle over the details.,anti-guns
"Those details are tricky, not in the least because a large portion of the country does not accept the overwhelming evidence that guns do, in fact, kill people—at least 36,623 in 2018 alone, including roughly 22,000 suicides.",anti-guns
The question then becomes one of delegation: Who will make the laws that take the guns?,anti-guns
"Will it be the federal government, the states, or local municipalities?",anti-guns
"Democratic presidential candidates like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker have, in recent days, found the courage to put forward aggressive gun control platforms.",anti-guns
"Harris pledged to take executive action and impose universal background checks if Congress does not present her with a plan within the first 100 days of her presidency, while Booker vowed to “fight the NRA” like never before and floated the idea of a national licensing system.",anti-guns
"As well-intentioned as these proposals might be, the fact remains that we cannot change the country’s relationship with guns with one federal sweeping law, or with an executive order that finally realizes the gun-grabbing boogeyman the NRA has terrorized its members with for decades.",anti-guns
"Instead, we need at least a three-tiered system of gun control: strict federal laws requiring universal background checks; closing gun show loopholes; and far harsher penalties on businesses and gunmakers found negligent in their sales.",anti-guns
We need sweeping federal changes and changes at the state and local level to even stand a chance at stemming the tide of gun violence.,anti-guns
"Because each state and each city and town is different, and therein lies the problem.",anti-guns
"In Pennsylvania right now, for example, the battle over gun jurisdiction is playing out in the state legislature, as Republican lawmakers—who control both chambers of Pennsylvania’s legislature—try to give increased control over gun laws to the state, and Democrats try to give cities and counties more power to pass local laws.",anti-guns
"In other states, however, the balance of power is reversed—Democrats have power in the statehouse, but Republicans control many local counties and jurisdictions, where local sheriffs in have vowed to create “gun sanctuaries” that ignore state or federal laws.",anti-guns
"Right now, there are rebellious local officials in Washington, New Mexico, Oregon and Illinois, but the practice will undoubtedly spread unless state and local jurisdictions can find a way to work together.",anti-guns
"Gun violence is just one symptom of this larger divide between urban and rural in America, but like healthcare and the opioid crisis and the labor struggles plaguing every industry, the solutions to it must take into account the country’s enormous size and diversity.",anti-guns
Gun control in New York City must look different than it does in rural Alaska.,anti-guns
"While robust federal laws instilling common-sense reform like background checks, licenses, and dealer accountability will provide a framework, they won’t be enough to enact real change without supplementary laws in smaller jurisdictions.",anti-guns
"The federal government needs a way to drastically decrease handgun ownership among American citizens as a whole and restrict the purchase and use of rifles and shotguns, ideally completely eradicating most firearms in urban areas.",anti-guns
"That does not, of course, mean that farmers in Kansas and Colorado and California should be stripped of their ability to keep a firearm for pests or hunting on their property.",anti-guns
There are other countries with a similar urban-rural divide that manage to preserve the use of firearms as a tool without allowing their citizens enough access to murder each other by the thousand every year.,anti-guns
"At the same time, flexible local laws do nothing without some form of federal consistency.",anti-guns
"Gun advocates often point to Chicago as an example that gun legislation doesn’t work to stop violence, noting that Chicago has strict gun laws and rampant gun violence.",anti-guns
"It’s a common argument rooted in a fallacy: Setting aside the fact that Chicago’s city gun laws aren’t as restrictive as they once were, this argument falls apart when you realize the city itself is adjacent to gun-lenient Wisconsin and Indiana, and it’s incredibly easy to transport a gun across state lines (in 2017, the city found that 60 percent of guns its police recovered after crimes came from outside Illinois).",anti-guns
Per an NPR factcheck of the Chicago gun laws claim:  It’s important to remember here that Chicago is very close to two states that have relatively weak gun laws: Wisconsin and Indiana.,anti-guns
"So while it’s easy to pick on Chicago (or any other high-crime city) for its ugly statistics, says one expert, taking bordering states into account weakens this gun-advocacy talking point.",anti-guns
“It’s not a scientific study.,anti-guns
"It’s an anecdote,” said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy studies at Duke University.",anti-guns
"“They might have pointed to Washington, D.C., back in the days when D.C. banned handguns and yet had high gun-violence rates.",anti-guns
"Those bans are only at best partially effective, because the borders are permeable.”  D.C. borders Virginia, which does not have strong gun laws.",anti-guns
(It gets a D from the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.),anti-guns
Cities like Chicago should seek stricter reforms on a local level.,anti-guns
"But without strict federal bans or penalties on the gun dealers supplying weapons inside and outside the state, as we’ve seen, local legislation is toothless.",anti-guns
"And while licenses and background checks may keep more mass shooters off the streets and guns out of the news, states are in some cases better equipped to combat other angles of the issue, like the straw purchases that often feed gun crime at a local level.",anti-guns
"Forcing local authorities to enforce constraints better served for larger municipalities or urban areas is a fool’s errand; so, too, are Pennsylvania Republicans’ plans to enforce gun laws at a state level that strips larger cities of the ability to protect their citizens.",anti-guns

There is no one catch-all fix to this issue.,anti-guns
"It is going to be messy, especially considering that in some instances, the NRA is even more powerful at the state level than it is in D.C.",anti-guns

Gun Control That Works.,anti-guns
"For far too long, those who oppose gun reforms have said that nothing can be done to stem the violence.",anti-guns

Thousands of people will descend on the Mall this week to protest gun violence in the United States.,anti-guns
"This movement should be informed by science, with specific policy proposals that could make a real impact.",anti-guns
Ban weapons of war  The Las Vegas massacre.,anti-guns
The massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.,anti-guns
"The movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo.",anti-guns
The Virginia Tech slaughter.,anti-guns
The massacre at the Texas First Baptist Church.,anti-guns
These are the five highest-casualty mass shootings in modern American history.,anti-guns
And what did they all have in common?,anti-guns
Semiautomatic weapons that allowed the shooter to fire into crowds without reloading.,anti-guns
"Based on the evidence we have, banning these weapons probably won’t do too much to curb overall gun deaths.",anti-guns
"We know this because in 1994, Congress passed legislation to outlaw the sale of certain types of semiautomatic guns and large-capacity magazines, and the effect was unimpressive.",anti-guns
"Gun homicide rates declined during the ban, but they also fell after the ban expired in 2004.",anti-guns
"One federally funded study of the ban found that the effect on violence was insignificant, partly because it was full of loopholes.",anti-guns
"Death tolls include victims killed by shooters within a day of the main shooting, including any who were killed in another way.",anti-guns
Totals also include people who later died from injuries received during the shootings.,anti-guns
2018 data through March 21.,anti-guns
But banning so-called assault weapons was never meant to reduce overall gun deaths.,anti-guns
It was meant to reduce gun deaths from mass shootings — even if these represent a small portion of gun violence.,anti-guns
"And in fact, mass shooting casualties dipped during the ban, although a review of studies by the Rand Corporation found the effect of the ban on mass shootings to be inconclusive.",anti-guns
We need to know more.,anti-guns
But research shows that semiautomatic weapons and weapons with high-capacity magazines are more dangerous than other weapons in shooting events.,anti-guns
One older study of handgun attacks in New Jersey shows that gunfire incidents involving semiautomatic weapons wounded 15 percent more people than shootings with other weapons.,anti-guns
Another more recent study from Minneapolis found that shootings with more than 10 shots fired accounted for between 20 and 28 percent of gun victims in the city.,anti-guns
So how do we keep such dangerous weapons from being used in crime?,anti-guns
"A ban on assault weapons might help, as data from a few cities during the 1994 ban suggest:  But experts say focusing on reducing large-capacity magazines might be more effective.",anti-guns
"Simply put, gunmen are less deadly when they have to reload.",anti-guns
"Such a ban might take time to have an effect, as a Post investigation shows.",anti-guns
But it would be worth it.,anti-guns
"Alarmingly, local crime data suggest that crimes committed with high-powered weapons have been on the rise since the 1994 ban ended.",anti-guns
"Again, mass shootings account for a small piece of the puzzle, so any ban on these weapons and magazines would result in marginal improvements, at best.",anti-guns
But even if this step reduced shootings by 1 percent — far less than what the Minneapolis study suggests — that would mean 650 fewer people shot a year.,anti-guns
Isn’t that worth it?,anti-guns
"Keep guns away from kids  Recently, we’ve heard proposals to raise age limits for semiautomatic weapons.",anti-guns
"Taken alone, this would do very little.",anti-guns
"Since 2009, men under 21 committed two mass shootings with semiautomatic rifles.",anti-guns
And one of those shootings involved a gun purchased illegally.,anti-guns
"But expanding existing age limits to all guns might be more effective, since young people are far more likely to commit homicide than older ones.",anti-guns
One survey of inmates found that setting a minimum age requirement of 21 could have prohibited gun possession in 17 percent of cases in which people legally owned a gun and used it to commit a crime.,anti-guns
"Opinion | Politicians should care as much about black gun violence victims as white  3:28 Pastor Michael McBride says while he loves the activism of the Parkland students, he wishes adults paid more attention to inner-city gun violence.",anti-guns
"(Gillian Brockell, Kate Woodsome, James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)  Of course, keeping guns out of the hands of young shooters would be difficult, because it’s so easy for people to obtain guns illegally.",anti-guns
"But age limits in general have proven to be effective in limiting bad behavior, so it’s worth trying.",anti-guns
There’s another reform that could be even more effective at keeping guns from kids: requiring gun owners to securely store firearms in a locked container or with a tamper-resistant mechanical lock.,anti-guns
Nearly 2 million minors in the United States live in homes where firearms are loaded and easy to access.,anti-guns
"And alarmingly, one study found that of the teens who had guns in their home who had attempted suicide in the past year, 40 percent had easy access to the firearm.",anti-guns
Another study from the federal government shows that 68 percent of school shootings are perpetrated by shooters who obtain a gun from their homes or the homes of relatives.,anti-guns
"In Massachusetts, which has the strictest safe-storage laws in the country, guns are used in just 9 percent of youth suicides, compared with 42 percent nationally.",anti-guns
The suicide death rate among youth in the state is 38 percent below the national average.,anti-guns
The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence also reports that states requiring locks on handguns in at least some circumstances have 40 percent fewer suicides per capita and 68 percent fewer firearm suicides per capita than states without such laws.,anti-guns
"Meanwhile, another safety innovation is being developed: smart guns.",anti-guns
These are guns that use fingerprint recognition and other means so that only their owners can fire them.,anti-guns
"The technology is still relatively new, but it’s promising.",anti-guns
"One small study found that over seven years, 37 percent of gun deaths could have been prevented by smart guns.",anti-guns
Lawmakers could encourage their use by incorporating them into laws regulating safe storage.,anti-guns
"Here’s a general rule: The more guns there are, the more gun deaths there will be.",anti-guns
It holds across countries (note how much the United States stands out):   And across states.,anti-guns
"One 2013 study from Boston University found that for every percentage point increase in gun ownership at the state level, there was a 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.",anti-guns
So how do we reduce the steady flow of guns?,anti-guns
Three ideas:  1.,anti-guns
"Institute a buyback program  In the 1990s, Australia spent $500 million to buy back almost 600,000 guns.",anti-guns
Harvard University researchers found that the gun homicide rate dropped 42 percent in the seven years following the law and the gun suicide rate fell 58 percent.,anti-guns
"An Australian study found that for every 3,500 guns withdrawn per 100,000 people, the government was able to achieve a 74 percent drop in gun suicides.",anti-guns
"In fact, since the ban, the country has not experienced another mass shooting.",anti-guns
That doesn’t proves causation.,anti-guns
But the likelihood it’s due to chance?,anti-guns
"Roughly 1 in 200,000, according to a recent paper.",anti-guns
"Of course, the United States is different from Australia.",anti-guns
"The Australian buyback was mandatory, which would probably run into constitutional problems here.",anti-guns
"Plus, we have way more guns per capita, so the United States would have to spend exponentially more to make a significant difference.",anti-guns
"Still, given Australia’s trends, it’s worth at least experimentation.",anti-guns
"Perhaps the government can use buyback programs to target specific kinds of weapons, such as semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity magazines.",anti-guns
Limit the number of guns people can buy at one time  Federal gun enforcers have long warned that state laws allowing bulk purchases of guns enable crime.,anti-guns
"Older studies from what is now called the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives show that as many as 1 in 5 handguns recovered in a crime were originally purchased as part of a sale in which multiple guns were purchased.",anti-guns
"To combat this behavior, some states have instituted “one handgun a month” policies, such as Virginia in 1993.",anti-guns
"At the time, Virginia was the top supplier of guns seized in the Northeast.",anti-guns
"Three years later, the state dropped to eighth.",anti-guns
Research also shows that the Virginia law was effective in reducing criminal firearms sent to nearby states.,anti-guns
It also led to a 35 percent reduction in guns recovered anywhere in the United States that were traced back to Virginia.,anti-guns
Such a policy isn’t going to solve gun trafficking.,anti-guns
The Virginia law didn’t prevent “straw purchases” in which traffickers pay people to buy guns legally so they can be sold elsewhere.,anti-guns
"In fact, Virginia remained the eighth-top supplier of illegal guns even after it repealed its one-handgun-a-month law in 2012.",anti-guns
But experts say one-gun-a-month laws make it more costly for criminals to traffic guns.,anti-guns
"And given the success in the past, such policies are worth promoting.",anti-guns
"Hold gun dealers accountable  Research has shown that in some cities, guns used to commit crimes often come from a small set of gun dealers.",anti-guns
"In Milwaukee, for example, a single dealer was linked to a majority of the guns used in the city’s crime.",anti-guns
So how do we stop the flow of those guns?,anti-guns
Hold dealers accountable.,anti-guns
"In 1999, the federal government published a report identifying gun shops connected with crime guns, including that Milwaukee dealer.",anti-guns
"In response to negative publicity, that dealer changed its sales practices.",anti-guns
"Afterward, the city saw a 76 percent reduction in the flow of new guns from that shop to criminals and a 44 percent reduction in new crime guns overall.",anti-guns
"But in 2003, Congress passed a law prohibiting the government from publishing such data, after which the rate of new gun sales from that dealer to criminals shot up 200 percent.",anti-guns
Studies show that regulation of licensed dealers — such as record-keeping requirements or inspection mandates — can also reduce interstate trafficking.,anti-guns
So can litigation against gun dealers that allow their guns to enter criminal markets.,anti-guns
One sting operation conducted by New York City reduced the probability of guns from the dealers they targeted ending up in the hands of criminals by 84 percent.,anti-guns
"Strengthen background checks  Federal law requires background checks to obtain a gun, but those checks are extremely porous.",anti-guns
"Under federal law, only licensed gun dealers have to perform these background checks.",anti-guns
Private individuals and many online retailers don’t.,anti-guns
"That leaves a lot of gun owners — about 42 percent, according to one survey published in 2017 — who didn’t undergo a background check for a gun purchase.",anti-guns
So what happens when states go beyond federal laws and require all handgun sales to undergo a background check?,anti-guns
Fewer gun deaths.,anti-guns
"Between 2009 and 2012, those states had 35 percent fewer gun deaths per capita than those without the requirement.",anti-guns
Those states also have 53 percent fewer firearm suicides and 31 percent fewer overall suicides per capita.,anti-guns
States are categorized from highest rate to lowest rate.,anti-guns
"Although adjusted for differences in age distribution and population size, rankings by state do not take into account other state-specific population characteristics that may affect the level of mortality.",anti-guns
"When the number of deaths is small, rankings by state may be unreliable due to volatility in death rates.",anti-guns
That doesn’t prove causation.,anti-guns
"In fact, a few states with expanded background checks have relatively high gun-death rates.",anti-guns
But we do know most gun offenders obtain their weapons through unlicensed sellers.,anti-guns
One survey of state prison inmates convicted of offenses committed with guns in 13 states found that only 13 percent obtained their guns from a seller that had to conduct a background check.,anti-guns
"Among those who were supposed to be prohibited from possessing a firearm, nearly all of them got their hands on one through suppliers that didn’t have to conduct a background check.",anti-guns
"Closing that loophole might help, although it’s questionable to what degree, since black markets already feed the flow of crime.",anti-guns
What else can we do to strengthen background checks?,anti-guns
Three possibilities:   Most gun background checks are instant.,anti-guns
"But some — around 9 percent — take more time, and federal law says if it takes more than three business days, the sale can proceed.",anti-guns
"As a result, thousands of people who were not supposed have access to guns ended up getting them, as the Government Accountability Office reported.",anti-guns
Among the people who benefited from this loophole?,anti-guns
"Dylann Roof, who killed nine people in Charleston, S.C., in 2015.",anti-guns
Ending this practice would save lives.,anti-guns
"Between 2006 and 2014, an average of 760 Americans were killed with guns annually by their spouses, ex-spouses or dating partners, according to an Associated Press analysis.",anti-guns
"Federal law prevents anyone with domestic violence misdemeanors from having a gun, but that law is defined narrowly and doesn’t include all domestic violence perpetrators — for example, boyfriends.",anti-guns
"More specifically, the law doesn’t keep guns from abusers who are not married, do not live with their partner or do not share a child with them.",anti-guns
Some states have expanded on federal law — and it works.,anti-guns
One study found that domestic-violence-related homicide rates decline 7 percent after a state passes such laws.,anti-guns
It’s not clear that waiting periods reduce violent crime.,anti-guns
But we’re pretty sure they prevent suicides.,anti-guns
"Research shows that people who buy handguns are at higher risk of suicide within a week of the purchase, and that waiting periods can keep them from using guns to commit suicide.",anti-guns
"In fact, one study found that when South Dakota repealed its 48-hour waiting period in 2012, suicides jumped 7.6 percent in the following year.",anti-guns
Mental illness is associated with a relatively small portion (around 5 percent) of gun homicides.,anti-guns
Federal law already prohibits anyone committed to a mental-health facility or deemed dangerous or lacking all mental capacities through a legal proceeding from having a gun.,anti-guns
But mental-health records are notoriously spotty.,anti-guns
There’s limited evidence that improved reporting at the state level might reduce violent crimes.,anti-guns
"Connecticut started reporting mental-health data to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2007, and one study found that violent crimes committed by people with mental illness there significantly decreased.",anti-guns
"We can also make it easier for family members to help loved ones with mental illness, by letting them seek court orders to disarm relatives who might do harm to themselves.",anti-guns
"In Connecticut, which has allowed this since 1999, one study estimates that the law averted 72 suicide attempts through 2013 from being fatal.",anti-guns
"Treat guns like we treat cars  Consider two data points: first in Connecticut, then in Missouri.",anti-guns
"In Connecticut, state lawmakers required people to get a license and safety training for a gun, just as we do for cars.",anti-guns
"In the decade after, it saw a drop in both gun homicides and suicides — at faster rates than other states without similar laws.",anti-guns
"And at the same time, Connecticut saw no significant drop in homicides not related to guns.",anti-guns
"In Missouri, the state legislature repealed its licensing requirements in 2007.",anti-guns
A study found that the law change was associated with an additional 55 to 63 homicides in each of the five years following the repeal — even as homicides committed without guns dropped.,anti-guns
"In both cases, it’s hard to prove a connection.",anti-guns
But these experiences do strongly suggest something we learned in our decades-long efforts to reduce vehicle-related deaths: Regulation saves lives.,anti-guns
It can also deter crime.,anti-guns
Research from the advocacy group Mayors Against Illegal Guns has found that guns sold in states with licensing laws — which are sometimes paired with mandatory registration of guns with local police — end up being exported for criminal activity at one-third the rate of states without the laws.,anti-guns
Because it’s much harder to feed guns into illegal markets if police can trace them to their legal gun owners.,anti-guns
"After Missouri repealed its licensing laws, police in Iowa and Illinois started reporting an increase in Missouri guns showing up at crime scenes.",anti-guns
"Gun control really works — here's the science to prove it There are more than 38,000 gun deaths in the US every year, and approximately 85,000 non-fatal injuries.",anti-guns
"Despite some restrictions on gun research, scientists have sought to evaluate how certain policies affect gun deaths.",anti-guns
"Policies that seem to reduce rates of gun violence include stricter background checks, limiting access to dangerous weapons, and prohibiting domestic abusers from owning weapons.",anti-guns
"On Sunday, a gunman opened fire at a Madden NFL video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida.",anti-guns
"The shooter killed at least two victims and himself, and shot at least nine others.",anti-guns
"As the country tries to figure out what — if anything — can be done in the wake of yet another mass shooting, it's worth taking a look at the evidence we have on the effects of gun regulations.",anti-guns
There are close to as many guns in the US as there are people.,anti-guns
"There may be more, or there may be fewer, depending on which study you look at — there's no exact count, since there isn't a national database of gun purchases or firearm owners, and federal law does not require a prospective gun owner to get a license or permit.",anti-guns
That's one of the many obstacles researchers come up against when trying to evaluate why so many people die from guns in the US.,anti-guns
But what they do know is that the number of gun deaths in the US is incredibly high.,anti-guns
"Most of these deaths are not from mass shootings, but from firearm suicides and murders.",anti-guns
"According to the American Public Health Association, guns kill more than 38,000 people per year and cause approximately 85,000 non-fatal injuries.",anti-guns
"There's still a lot we don't know about this recent recent shooting, including whether the shooter purchased his weapon legally or if any common policy recommendations would have stopped him from obtaining a weapon.",anti-guns
Yet we do have evidence on effective policies that could have helped prevent some incidents.,anti-guns
"Despite some congressional limitations on gun research, scientists have sought to evaluate the effects of gun-control legislation in the US and in other places around the world.",anti-guns
Here's what the data shows.,anti-guns
Making it easier to carry concealed guns increases the number of gun homicides.,anti-guns
"A Glock handgun available in a raffle promotion is shown at Adventures Outdoors in Smyrna, Georgia, October 25, 2012.",anti-guns
REUTERS/Tami Chappell A Glock handgun.,anti-guns
"Thomson Reuters In states that have so-called right-to-carry laws, anyone who is allowed to own guns and meets the necessary conditions can also get a concealed-carry permit.",anti-guns
Many people have argued that right-to-carry laws deter crime because there could be more armed people around to stop a shooter.,anti-guns
"Though that idea was supported by a controversial 1997 analysis, recent and more thorough analyses have found the opposite effect.",anti-guns
One recent study found that such laws increased the rate of firearm homicides by 9% when homicide rates were compared state by state.,anti-guns
That could be because confrontations were more likely to escalate to involve guns or because there were more guns around that could be stolen.,anti-guns
Other factors could also be at play.,anti-guns
"A spike in gun purchases after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School led to an increase in accidental gun deaths, especially among kids.",anti-guns
"sandy hook shooting newtown Research has found that when people are around more guns, they're more likely to end up dying from accidental shootings.",anti-guns
"After a 20-year-old man killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012, there were calls for legislation that would limit some people's access to firearms.",anti-guns
That push resulted in what's now become a predictable phenomenon after shootings: people bought lots of guns.,anti-guns
"With more guns around in the months after the school shooting, the rate of accidental deaths related to firearms rose sharply, especially among children, according to a recent study published in the journal Science.",anti-guns
The researchers' calculations showed that 40 adults and 20 children died as a result of those additional gun purchases.,anti-guns
Barring people convicted of domestic abuse from owning guns has a huge effect on the number of gun deaths.,anti-guns
gun show  AP The so-called Lautenberg amendment to the 1968 Gun Control Act disqualifies people with a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence from buying or owning weapons.,anti-guns
Researchers found that gun murders of female intimate partners decreased by 17% as a result of the amendment.,anti-guns
Laws that call for longer sentences for gun crimes also seem to help a little.,anti-guns
corcoran state prison california Associated Press/Ben Margot Gun-robbery rates have gone down in states that have approved longer sentences for assault or robbery with a gun.,anti-guns
"In the 1970s and 1980s, there were 30 ""add-on"" sentencing laws calling for additional prison time for people convicted of robbery or assault with a gun.",anti-guns
A 40-year-analysis found that gun-robbery rates dropped by about 5% in the years after the sentencing laws were enacted.,anti-guns
States that have stricter gun-control laws and spend more money on education and mental-health care have fewer school shootings.,anti-guns
"Parkland Florida shooting AP Photo/Gerald Herbert One recent study found that states with fewer school shootings tended to have stricter background checks for weapon and ammunition purchases, and also spent more money on education and mental-health care.",anti-guns
"Though school shootings are not the most common form of gun violence, a recent spike in these types of events in the US has prompted concern.",anti-guns
"There was an average of one school shooting per year from 1966 to 2008, but an average of one per week from 2013 to 2015, the study found.",anti-guns
"The researchers said that based on available data, it was difficult to say which factor was most important in reducing shootings in schools.",anti-guns
"However, mental-health treatment is unlikely to be solely responsible, as people with mental illness are more likely to be a victim of violence than a perpetrator.",anti-guns
"Though about 20% of Americans have some form of mental illness, people with a serious mental-health problem account for only about 3% of violent crime.",anti-guns
"After Congress let a 1994 ban on assault weapons expire in 2004, gun massacre deaths skyrocketed.",anti-guns
"AR15 Rifle via Wikimedia Commons Arguments about the exact meaning of ""assault weapon"" obfuscate an important point: When people in the US were allowed to start buying military-style firearms with high-capacity magazines, the number of people killed in gun massacres (defined as shootings in which at least six people die) shot up.",anti-guns
"The number of gun massacres and massacre deaths decreased by 37% and 43%  respectively after the 1994 ban on assault weapons went into effect, one researcher found.",anti-guns
"After it expired in 2004, they shot up by 183% and 239%.",anti-guns
"There's debate over the effectiveness of this legislation in reducing overall gun crime or firearm deaths, since most gun deaths in the US are suicides and most murders involve a handgun.",anti-guns
But most of the deadliest mass shootings in recent US history have one thing in common: They involved a military-style weapon with a high-capacity magazine.,anti-guns
"According to one study, replacing medium- and large-caliber weapons with small-caliber guns would dramatically reduce gun homicide rates.",anti-guns
"gunshot window Getty Images/John Moore For a study published in July, researchers examined data about 511 gunshot victims from files kept by the Boston Police Department.",anti-guns
They found that weapon caliber — which refers to the diameter of the firearm barrel and is an indication of the diameter of the bullet — played a big role in how fatal shootings were.,anti-guns
Caliber didn't affect where on the body people got shot.,anti-guns
But people who were shot with larger bullets were more likely to die.,anti-guns
"People shot with medium-caliber weapons (defined as .38, .380, and 9 mm) were more than twice as likely to die as those shot with small-caliber guns (defined as .22, .25, and .32 mm).",anti-guns
"People shot with large caliber weapons (.357 magnum, .40, .44 magnum, .45, 10 mm, and 7.62 × 39 mm) were more than four and a half times as likely to die as those shot with small-caliber firearms.",anti-guns
"All in all, the researchers found that replacing large- and medium-caliber guns with small ones would have reduced homicide rates by 39.5%.",anti-guns
Reducing access to guns could reduce the number of suicides in the US.,anti-guns
"Gun Some gun-rights advocates argue that if you limit access to guns, people will just find other ways to kill themselves or others.",anti-guns
"But data indicates that this ""substitution hypothesis"" is not correct.",anti-guns
"More than 60% of gun deaths in the US are suicides, and research has found that people are most likely to try to kill themselves shortly after they decide to do so.",anti-guns
People who attempt to do that with a gun as opposed to another method are much more likely to kill themselves.,anti-guns
"Data from other countries supports restricting gun access, too.",anti-guns
"When the Israel Defense Forces stopped letting troops bring weapons home on the weekends, suicide rates dropped by 40%, one study found.",anti-guns
"Historically, suicides also dropped after the UK switched from coal-gas ovens — which used a gas that people inhaled to kill themselves — to a different type of fuel.",anti-guns
"The country saw an increase in the use of other methods to attempt suicide, but it did not offset the drop in suicides by coal gas.",anti-guns
Weapons buy-back programs have been successful in reducing mass shootings.,anti-guns
"gun buyback australia David Gray/Reuters After at 1996 mass shooting left 35 people dead in Australia, the country said ""enough.""",anti-guns
Leaders swiftly enacted gun-control legislation and set up a program for citizens to sell their weapons back to the government so they could be destroyed.,anti-guns
The initiative seems to have been successful: firearm suicides dropped by 65% and homicides by 59% over the next 10 years.,anti-guns
"While Australia had seen 13 mass shootings — defined as five or more deaths — in the 18 years before the 1996 massacre, there has only been one in the 22 years since.",anti-guns

The US has a higher rate of gun violence than any other similarly wealthy country.,anti-guns
Why not try to change that?,anti-guns
nra convention guns american flag Whitney Curtis/Getty Images The US has far more mass shootings than just about any country in the world.,anti-guns
"Of countries with at least 10 million people, there are more mass shootings per capita in only Yemen, which has the second-highest per-capita rate of gun ownership (the US has the highest).",anti-guns
"Even other countries with lots of guns, like Switzerland, have far fewer firearm deaths.",anti-guns
"In Switzerland, however, most people gain access to weapons because of military service that provides training; other prospective purchasers have to go through a multiweek background check.",anti-guns
Authorities there also prohibit some citizens whom psychologists deem a potential risk from owning weapons.,anti-guns
The US is not inherently a more violent society.,anti-guns
What sets the country apart is that it has a lot of guns that are still really easy to get.,anti-guns
"The data that we have indicates that some gun-control measures — like banning some types of weapons, improving background checks, and putting more restrictions on weapon access — could help.",anti-guns
"At the very least, gathering and analyzing data could help leaders determine what sort of changes might help prevent another Parkland, Las Vegas, or Sandy Hook.",anti-guns

A Constitutional Case for Gun Control Supreme Court briefs are not known for their colorful writing.,anti-guns
Readers are far more likely to encounter austere Latin legalisms than gripping personal narratives.,anti-guns
Yet March for Our Lives chose to upend this norm in its amicus brief—a legal filing written by an interested outside party—in the upcoming Supreme Court case New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v. City of New York.,anti-guns
"Its brief “presents the voices and stories of young people from Parkland, Florida, to South Central Los Angeles who have been affected directly and indirectly by gun violence.”   The Supreme Court confirmed earlier this month that it would hear the case later this term, its first gun-rights case in nearly a decade.",anti-guns
At issue is whether a New York City regulation that prevents licensed gun owners from transporting their firearms to second homes or gun ranges outside the city runs afoul of the Second Amendment.,anti-guns
"The stakes are high: The case offers the Court’s conservative wing a vehicle to further solidify legal barriers to firearm regulation, a decades-long project that has thus far been quite successful—in part due to the appeal of a unified constitutional narrative that pro-gun voices have invoked across both the legal and the political spheres.",anti-guns
"The Second Amendment, they say, protects an individual’s right to gun ownership, a right rooted in deeply held notions of self-defense and individual reliance.",anti-guns
"For decades, gun-control advocates have left this narrative partially unanswered, offering depressing statistics but no compelling constitutional principle.",anti-guns
They cannot afford to do so any longer.,anti-guns
"The March for Our Lives brief marks the beginning of a long-needed effort to offer a pro-gun-control constitutional narrative, one that calls attention to the constitutional rights and goods vindicated by gun regulation.",anti-guns
"These include a collective understanding of self-defense, as well as constitutional guarantees such as the right to public assembly and interests such as access to public education.",anti-guns
"The point is that the right to bear arms is not the only constitutional commitment implicated in the guns debate, and the Court ought to consider those other commitments as worth balancing with the right to bear arms, not as inherently subordinate to it.",anti-guns
We call our foundational legal text a Constitution because it constitutes our legal and political reality.,anti-guns
The March for Our Lives brief is a reminder to the Court that it cannot ignore the world it creates through its interpretation of the Second Amendment.,anti-guns
"The brief asks the Court to confront the consequences of the gun lobby’s myopic approach, and it does so by bringing in the voices of young people whose lives have been upended by gun violence.",anti-guns
"It recounts the narratives of Aalayah Eastmond, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas student who “saw blood pooling on the floor” and a fellow student “slumped against the wall, dead”; Jackson Mittleman, a sixth grader who comforted the siblings of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting as they contemplated the loss of their 6-year-old brother; and Brooke Harrison, another Stoneman Douglas student, who saw “a lifelong friend” shot at his desk and was forced to “watch ... his body go limp.”  Gun-control advocates have long been making these sorts of arguments outside the legal sphere, at town halls and televised rallies.",anti-guns
The March for Our Lives brief takes its inspiration from these more democratic arenas and brings that approach into the courtroom.,anti-guns
This differs markedly from the legal arguments gun-control advocates have used for decades.,anti-guns
"In courtrooms and law schools, advocates for regulation have traditionally made their case with more anodyne tools—textual analysis and statistics.",anti-guns
They have staked their claim on the textual reasoning that the word militia in the Second Amendment puts regulation of individual civilian gun ownership beyond the amendment’s scope.,anti-guns
"Regarding statistics, consider the brief filed by the American Academy of Pediatrics in the landmark 2008 gun-rights case District of Columbia v. Heller, which cited more than 50 academic or governmental studies on gun violence and related issues.",anti-guns
"Conservative supporters of gun rights have long known that such approaches, on their own, are insufficient.",anti-guns
"Consider the amicus brief filed in Heller by then–Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz, which cited figures such as George Mason and James Madison to paint a picture of an individual right that was core to the American idea.",anti-guns
"As Cruz wrote, “The Framers were understandably wary of standing armies and the powers of a potentially oppressive government.” On this view, an individual right to bear arms ensures “a citizenry capable of defending its rights by force, when all other means have failed, against any future oppression.” This narrative does not just rely on dry points of law—it tells a story in which gun regulation is simply un-American and runs contrary to familiar values such as liberty, individualism, and opposition to tyranny.",anti-guns
"Gun-control advocates need their own constitutional narrative, one that incorporates a broader conception of self-defense into its vision.",anti-guns
"Since Heller, the Court has drawn a straight line connecting the broader, constitutionally grounded right to self-defense to the more specific right to individual gun ownership.",anti-guns
But defense of oneself and one’s family can be pursued in a variety of ways.,anti-guns
"An individual right to gun ownership offers one path, deputizing all people to defend themselves with a firearm at their side.",anti-guns
"Gun regulation offers another such path to self-defense, one vastly more efficacious and preferred by the American public.",anti-guns
"It represents a mode of preemptive self-defense, whereby the state is tasked by its citizens with limiting access to deadly force.",anti-guns
"On this view, when we urge the government to enact universal background checks, raise the legal age to purchase firearms from 18 to 21, and ban the sale of assault weapons, we are seeking to use the government’s regulatory authority—rather than, say, the arming of every schoolteacher—to defend ourselves and our children.",anti-guns
That the gun-rights movement has somehow managed to monopolize the constitutional mantle of “self-defense” is as impressive a PR feat as it is absurd.,anti-guns
"In addition to self-defense, other obvious rights and interests of constitutional magnitude are imperiled by gun violence and vindicated by regulation.",anti-guns
The right to assembly is put at risk when a single shooter can rain bullets on a peaceful political protest.,anti-guns
"Freedom of the press is undermined when published words can give way to mass murder, as occurred at The Capital’s Annapolis, Maryland, office in 2018.",anti-guns
"Other cherished constitutional interests, such as the freedom to vote or access to public education, cannot be secured when mass shootings are a constant specter outside polling places or at the schoolhouse gate.",anti-guns
"And this is to say nothing of the value of protecting life, a fundamental basis of the Constitution itself that is incompatible with an ever-expanding conception of the Second Amendment.",anti-guns
"Even when upholding gun regulations, American courts rarely, if ever, reference these counterbalancing constitutional values.",anti-guns
"Instead, regulation is presented in sterile, technocratic terms—at best permissible, but never a constitutionally inspired imperative.",anti-guns
How can courts do otherwise when they lack a narrative that locates these values at the heart of the constitutional debate over guns?,anti-guns
"Constitutional narratives drawn from the contemporary world are, admittedly, a bit novel in today’s legal arena.",anti-guns
"This is, in part, the result of a decades-long effort by right-leaning gun advocates, lawyers, and scholars to frame arguments that rely on anything but the Constitution’s text and the original values recognized at the time of the founding as not constitutionally valid.",anti-guns
Their interpretive methodologies—aptly named “textualism” and “originalism”—deny constitutional imprimatur to rights and interests that cannot be identified in the Constitution’s plain text or found in narratives premised on the writings of long-dead men.,anti-guns
But it need not be this way.,anti-guns
"In the words of Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson, constitutional interpretation that ignores its real-world implications “will convert the constitutional Bill of Rights into a suicide pact.” Jackson surely had no idea how literal his suicide metaphor would become.",anti-guns
"Constitutional narratives that account for the world they engender and the way they balance competing rights offer an answer to his admonition, infusing constitutional debates with practical lessons drawn from reality.",anti-guns
Such narratives are not merely politically expedient.,anti-guns
"They have long been an integral component of our constitutional culture, shaping popular understanding of our Constitution and, in turn, judicial decisions that reflect this understanding.",anti-guns
"By connecting the Constitution to those whose lives it governs and the values that motivate them, constitutional narratives are a distinctively democratic form of argument.",anti-guns
"In one of the most famous works of legal scholarship of the 20th century, the late Yale law professor Robert Cover wrote, “No set of legal institutions or prescriptions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning.” According to Cover, narrative is what gives law moral authority, what imbues it with the power not to compel mere obedience, but to embody the legitimate choices of those it governs.",anti-guns
"It is why Thurgood Marshall, then a lawyer arguing Brown v. Board, emphasized the psychological harm inflicted on African American children by segregation, rather than appealing to the text of the Equal Protection Clause or constitutional doctrine alone.",anti-guns
"Law is a distinctly human endeavor, and narrative is what connects dry legal text to the world it creates.",anti-guns
Gun-control advocates must reclaim the Constitution from the pro-gun lobby.,anti-guns
"The March for Our Lives brief is a step toward building a constitutional architecture that makes room for these sidelined constitutional values, one that properly integrates law with reality.",anti-guns
It recognizes the pain of those whose lives have been upended by the elevation of founding-era mythology above present-day tragedy.,anti-guns
"And by putting the gun violence permeating America’s streets and schools directly in front of the Supreme Court as it confronts a high-profile case, the brief ensures that this narrative will be heard.",anti-guns
"Op-Ed: We have all the data we need: Stronger gun laws would save lives The day after the shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla., House Speaker Paul Ryan sounded a cautious note: “I think as public policy makers, we don’t just knee-jerk before we even have all of the facts and the data.”  It’s a common refrain from politicians opposed to strengthening gun laws: They use “lack of data” as a fig leaf for their inaction.",anti-guns
But there is no lack of data.,anti-guns
"Our organizations, GVPedia and the Gun Violence Archive, have amassed the relevant research, facts and data — and it all points to the need for legislative action on gun violence.",anti-guns
"The misconception that gun violence has not been researched began with the infamous 1996 Dickey Amendment, a gun-lobby rider attached to an omnibus appropriations bill that prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using any funds “to advocate or promote gun control.” At the same time, Congress cut the agency’s budget by the exact amount it used to research gun violence.",anti-guns
The message was clear.,anti-guns
"Although the amendment dealt a significant blow to research on gun violence, it did not end it.",anti-guns
"GVPedia has collected more than 740 academic studies and papers on the subject, a majority of which were published after 1996.",anti-guns
"The best of this work, combined with detailed data on gun deaths and injuries from the Gun Violence Archive, tell a clear story about what can help stop mass shootings in America.",anti-guns
"Following tragedies such as the killings in Parkland, Las Vegas and Sandy Hook, gun apologists are fond of saying that stricter laws wouldn’t have prevented the carnage.",anti-guns
Yet we can easily see that this claim was false in Parkland.,anti-guns
The shooter at Stoneman Douglas High had a long history of red flags that didn’t show up in the national database but were well-known to local police.,anti-guns
A law that would have required a gun buyer to apply for and get a permit at the discretion of law enforcement could have empowered authorities to deny the shooter access to an AR-15.,anti-guns
The best research shows what common sense tells us: More guns mean more crime and more death.,anti-guns

"Multiple studies from researchers at Johns Hopkins University have found that such “permit to purchase” laws, which include a particularly strong background check, reduce homicides, suicides and gun trafficking.",anti-guns
Literature reviews that examine a wide range of gun policies throughout the U.S. also consistently find that these laws save lives.,anti-guns
Research also shows that domestic violence restraining orders with the teeth to remove firearms from abusers reduce intimate-partner homicide.,anti-guns
"Likewise, banning high-capacity magazines would likely reduce the deadly outcome of shootings.",anti-guns
Australia’s ban and buyback of semi-automatic firearms significantly reduced gun deaths in that country.,anti-guns
"Instead of stricter purchase and ownership rules, the gun lobby and its allies claim that a “guns everywhere” agenda will reduce violence because, as the National Rifle Assn.",anti-guns
"puts it, “the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.”  Among the lobby’s most prominent efforts is passing “concealed carry reciprocity” legislation.",anti-guns
"HR 38, a national reciprocity bill, passed by the House in December, is now in the Senate Judiciary Committee.",anti-guns
"It would allow a concealed-carry license from one state to apply in all states, which means that weaker standards for carrying firearms in say, Louisiana, could trump stricter regulations in California.",anti-guns
Recent research shows how dangerous reciprocity would be.,anti-guns
A 2017 study in the American Journal of Public Health correlated minimally restrictive “right to carry” laws with a 6.5% increase in total homicide rates and an 8.6% higher firearm homicide rates.,anti-guns
"Another 2017 study, by John Donohue of Stanford University, found that such laws were consistently associated with increases in violent crime.",anti-guns
These two studies are backed by earlier research also showing that minimal standards for carrying firearms bring down the rate of violent crime.,anti-guns
The push to get firearms into more hands is based on the false notion that defensive gun use — DGU — is widespread and effective at preventing injury.,anti-guns
The gun lobby and its allies tout research that put the number of defensive gun uses at approximately 2.5 million a year.,anti-guns
"However, the methodology behind that figure has been called into question by David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.",anti-guns
"And, by combing through media and police reports, the Gun Violence Archive documented approximately 2,000 verified DGUs in 2017, which also casts doubt on the 2.5-million estimate.",anti-guns
"As to the efficacy of DGUs, a 2015 Hemenway study showed that using a gun in self-defense is no better at preventing injury than alternative means such as doing nothing or running away.",anti-guns
"In reality, the best research shows what common sense tells us: More guns mean more crime and more death.",anti-guns
Gun possession significantly increases your risk of being killed by someone you know.,anti-guns
A gun in the home doubles your risk of homicide and triples your risk of suicide.,anti-guns
The presence of a gun increases the lethality of domestic violence.,anti-guns
Areas with higher gun ownership see a significant increase in burglary.,anti-guns
And states with higher levels of gun ownership experience higher rates of firearm fatalities.,anti-guns
The Dickey Amendment should be overturned.,anti-guns
"We undoubtedly need more research on the public health effects of gun laws, gun ownership and gun use.",anti-guns
But the need for more studies is no excuse for ignoring the research that already exists; it is no excuse for inaction.,anti-guns
"The best data are clear: More guns mean more carnage, and stronger gun laws save lives.",anti-guns
"Legislation that reduces the easy availability and number of firearms is the best way to respond to mass school shootings, church shootings, domestic violence and firearm-suicide.",anti-guns

"The Top 3 Arguments for Gun Control In 2014, a nine-year-old girl accidentally shot her gun instructor to death during a lesson in how to fire an Uzi in Arizona.",anti-guns
"Leaving aside the question about why anyone would ever allow a child of that age to have an Uzi in her hands, for any reason, we might also ask why anyone, of any age, needs to learn how to fire an assault weapon like an Uzi in the first place.",anti-guns
The National Rifle Association would respond to that question by claiming that the United States Constitution does not place any restrictions on gun ownership in America.,anti-guns
"So if you want to fire an Uzi, by all means, have at it.",anti-guns
"But that's a dangerous and illogical interpretation of the Second Amendment's ""right to bear arms.""",anti-guns
"As Seth Millstein asked on Bustle.com, ""If you think the Second Amendment prohibits any and all restrictions on gun possession in the U.S. no matter what the circumstances, then you must believe that convicted murderers have the right to carry machine guns in prison.",anti-guns
"So how would a liberal respond to incidents like this one, an incident that will haunt not only the family of the slain victim but also of the shooter, that little nine-year-old who will have to live with that image in her mind for the rest of her life?",anti-guns
Use these top three points the next time you defend the need for gun control:  Gun-rights advocates and other extremists act like every attempt to create sane and logical regulations on guns is a fascist assault on their freedom.,anti-guns
But a quick look at other nations shows this to be untrue.,anti-guns
"Australia, which has a similar frontier history to that of the United States, enacted gun control following the horrific ​Port Art​hur Massacre, in which a deranged man murdered 35 town residents and wounded 23 more.",anti-guns
The restrictions were enacted by a conservative Prime Minister and resulted in a 59% drop in gun-homicides there.,anti-guns
"Further, recent studies reveal that ""higher gun ownership rates were correlated with higher homicide rates, both within the U.S. and amongst different high-income countries.""",anti-guns
"You Do NOT Have the Right to Own Any Gun You Want The Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. Chicago (2010) that while private citizens can own weapons, they are also subject to restrictions on those weapons.",anti-guns

Minors can't buy alcohol and we can't buy cold medicine right off the shelf because our society decided that we need to protect citizens from drug abuse and trafficking.,anti-guns
It's not a leap to insist that we also regulate guns to protect Americans from gun violence.,anti-guns
Few Guns Means Fewer Gun Crimes Period It's common for gun advocates to claim that the solution to gun violence is to be more heavily armed so that you can take out someone brandishing a weapon against you.,anti-guns
"That view is summed up by the popular saying, ""The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.""",anti-guns
"But again, that's an illogical argument.",anti-guns
"As succinctly stated by Joshua Sager on The Progressive Cynic, gun control means that fewer guns in society means that ""as guns are harder to obtain legally and illegal guns become harder to come by (when more guns are confiscated by the police or are used in murders and disposed of then are put onto the street), it will become harder for criminals to find access to clean guns.""",anti-guns
"Why We Need Gun Control These three points are rooted in logic, fairness, and the idea that we all have to live together in this society.",anti-guns
"That is the essence of democracy, and our democracy is based on the idea that we have a social contract that will ensure the well-being of all citizens — not just gun fetishists.",anti-guns
"And that's the ultimate reason we need gun control: the American people should not have to live in fear every time they enter a public place, send their children to school, or sleep in their own beds at night.",anti-guns
The time has come to bring common sense to the dialogue on gun control.,anti-guns
"Better gun laws could save thousands of lives, major non-partisan US study finds  This article is more than 1 year old Authors say research into assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and other proposals helps fill gaps in ‘a fact-free environment’ Passing an assault weapons ban might prevent 170 mass shooting deaths a year in the US, experts who support gun control estimate.",anti-guns
"Passing a universal background check law could prevent 1,100 gun homicides each year.",anti-guns
"Raising the age limit for buying firearms could prevent 1,600 homicides and suicides.",anti-guns
These are some of the new estimates in a groundbreaking study of the potential impact of American gun control laws.,anti-guns
"The non-partisan analysis, based on a review of existing gun policy research and a survey of the best guesses of both gun rights and gun control experts, was , which spent two years and more than $1m on the project.",anti-guns
Rand’s review of the existing research concluded that only a handful of gun control laws were backed by strong research evidence.,anti-guns
"Child access prevention laws, which are designed to keep guns out of the hands of children, had the strongest evidence behind them, the researchers concluded, and appeared to reduce gun injuries and suicides.",anti-guns
"The review also found “moderate evidence” that background checks reduce firearm suicides and homicides, and that certain mental health gun prohibitions reduced violent crime.",anti-guns
"The Rand review also found “moderate evidence” that “stand your ground” laws, which allow Americans to use guns to defend themselves without first attempting to retreat from a confrontation, may increase state homicide rates.",anti-guns
What the two-year project revealed most starkly were the gaping holes in both the research and the basic data needed to understand what gun laws might save the most lives.,anti-guns
There was only “inconclusive” research evidence about the impact of a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines on mass shootings and on violent crime.,anti-guns
There was no rigorous research of any kind about the impact of gun-free zones.,anti-guns
The research on the impact of laws making it easier to carry concealed firearms was “limited” or inconclusive”.,anti-guns
"That lack of evidence is not an accident, but a political choice, shaped by more than two decades of opposition to federally funded gun research from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other gun rights advocates.",anti-guns
"Having no research to answer crucial gun debate questions “creates a fact-free environment, where people can make claims that make problems for legislation moving forward”, Andrew Morral, the lead researcher on the project, said.",anti-guns
Congressional Republicans passed the 1996 Dickey amendment to pressure the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) away from conducting public health research on gun violence.,anti-guns
The political pressures have never amounted to a total ban on federal funding for gun-related research.,anti-guns
"The justice department, for instance, has continued to fund important studies in this area, often focused on policing and community strategies for preventing shootings.",anti-guns
But the amount of money the US government spends on research to prevent gun deaths is a fraction of the amount it spends on comparably prevalent causes of death and injury.,anti-guns
"To fill in those gaping holes in what Americans know about how different gun control laws might work, Rand did what policymakers might do when there is no study offering a simple answer: they surveyed longtime gun policy experts about their best guesses about the impact of different laws.",anti-guns
"The experts, who included gun policy researchers and affiliates of advocacy groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, provided their best guesses about how much a given law might affect gun homicides, gun suicides, gun accidents and mass shooting deaths, as well as how much each policy might affect gun industry sales.",anti-guns
"Rand sorted out experts by their self-described affinity to gun rights or gun control groups, and these two groups of experts often provided opposite estimates of what impact the policies might have.",anti-guns
"Gun rights advocates guessed than a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines might lead to a 1% increase in gun homicides, or 100 more lives lost.",anti-guns
"Unlike most in-depth research studies, Rand’s project is designed to be accessible to the public.",anti-guns
"It includes a website that allows users to explore the potential human impact of passing individual gun laws, or packages of potential gun law compromises.",anti-guns
"Guns are a part of the modern world, in the past they were used for hunting and they were not a very efficient or trustworthy weapon.",anti-guns
"Now technology has advanced guns into full out killing machines, and rules are needed to regulate the accessibility of these life ending devices.",anti-guns
"Although, are these rules that governments have invoked actually helping reduce gun violence by a large degree?",anti-guns
Are guns really necessary in society at all?,anti-guns
"Looking into five different countries to determine whether gun control laws have proven to be effective, or if they were to be removed, no change would be seen.",anti-guns
The United States is an anomaly.,anti-guns
The country has a strong federal government and lives by the people.,anti-guns
Federal rules and regulations stretch for miles on end.,anti-guns
"Gun control regulations are no exception, however, for a developed country, it boasts the highest homicide-by-firearm rate and ranks number one in firearms per capita (Masters).",anti-guns
"Although background checks, license requirements and individual state regulations exist (some more strict than others), the Second Amendment prevents the United States from having truly effective gun control rules and regulations (Masters).",anti-guns
"The Second Amendment states: ""A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""",anti-guns
"Even with background checks and licenses as regulations, at the end of the day the Second Amendment provides the American people with a much easier access to firearms because it is a right.",anti-guns
"With so much availability the death rate by firearms will remain high for the United States, proving their gun control laws semi ineffective until more strict rules are in place.",anti-guns
The shooting sparked a massive federal response and in under two weeks the government reevaluated their gun rules and regulations looking to fit the more modern times (Sterbenz).,anti-guns
Seeking guidance from other states with strong gun control Australia revamped their rules and regulations.,anti-guns
Steps were put into place to virtually eliminate all assault weapons.,anti-guns
"To increase the effectiveness of this ruling, the nation implemented a buyback program and removed over 650,000 weapons from the public (Masters).",anti-guns
"In addition, those who want to own a gun must have a reasonable need for ownership of a weapon in which ""self defense"" was not a valid reason (Sterbenz).",anti-guns
"Unlike the United States, bearing arms in Australia is not a right in its constitution, and this buyback program proved effective.",anti-guns
"By making weapons harder to obtain and removing many of guns currently in circulation, Australia saw great success at reducing gun violence.",anti-guns
"Within 20 years from 1996, the odds of being murdered by a gun decreased 72% from 0.54 per 100,000 to 0.15 per 100,00 people (Kayne and Cole).",anti-guns
Many supports of gun control claim the United States could follow Australia's successful and effective gun control rules and regulations.,anti-guns
"Honduras is home to sea routes, air drop zones and land routes for gun trafficking.",anti-guns
The accessibility criminals have to firearms mixed with corruption and drug cartels is a recipe for gun violence.,anti-guns
"Many criminal groups hold a piece of power in the area, so a huge black market flourishes selling guns and ammunition in Honduras (Gagne).",anti-guns
The criminal groups are the de facto power and beat out each other for control.,anti-guns
"Although Honduras has a government trying to control the trafficking, the over 1 million weapons in circulation makes this task all but possible (Gagne).",anti-guns
Honduras' gun control laws are completely ineffective because the government cannot issue force over the criminal groups.,anti-guns
Along with the overflowing access to guns Honduras will remain high in death rates from gun violence.,anti-guns
"Israel requires military service from its citizens; when one turns 18 they are screened, and take a gun safety course along with other military training.",anti-guns
Israel does not allow citizens to have guns unless they are in the military or have a reasonable need to carry a firearm (Masters).,anti-guns
"People with security jobs, or those who carry objects of value often can obtain a firearm.",anti-guns
Many Israelis carry firearms as a result of military involvement and personal protection (Masters).,anti-guns
"Israel is in a dangerous neighborhood near Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and Saudi Arabia so citizens take personal protection quite seriously.",anti-guns
"Israel's gun access would predict the same high death rate as Honduras, but the country actually commands a very low homicide by gun rate (Masters).",anti-guns
"Due to the amount of gun safety, and the fact that practically everyone has and carries around guns for protection, Israel sees guns as just part of everyday life.",anti-guns
"A different culture surrounds guns in Israel and this responsibility around firearms brews low death rates and therefore, effective gun control laws.",anti-guns
"Japan (Practically) No Gun Zone Japan is a perfect example of strict arms control, and for good reason.",anti-guns
"Obtaining a gun is totally legal and doable in Japan, but unlike America where it is a right, unlike Honduras where the street is littered with guns, unlike Israel who have guns from military work, and unlike Australia which took a bloody massacre to jump start more strict laws, Japan requires a series of patient and determination hoops to jump through.",anti-guns
For those who want to own a gun in Japan one must first take an all-day safety course and pass the written exam.,anti-guns
Then one must shoot at least a 95% on their marksman test.,anti-guns
"The fun does not stop there, a deep and rigorous background check which includes: criminal records, drug use both illegal and prescription based, and mental health screenings.",anti-guns
The buyer's relatives and even work colleagues are also checked for links to extremist groups and a background check is preformed (Low).,anti-guns
"Furthermore, yearly inspections are required, detailed information of how the guns and ammunition are stored, and a license expiration of three years are just some of many rules and regulations Japan has in place (Masters).",anti-guns
"The results are tremendous, Japan has very low gun ownership and death rate as it commands the lowest homicide by guns rate in the world.",anti-guns
"In 2014, only 6 deaths by gunfire occurred in Japan, compared to the 33,599 deaths in the United States (Low).",anti-guns
The stigma around guns is undesirable in Japan and nobody wants to go through the lengthly process to obtain a gun.,anti-guns
"The gun control laws are strict, but prove to be extremely effective at keeping gun violence low.",anti-guns
"Conclusion Are gun control laws effective, and are guns necessary in society?",anti-guns
There is no clear cut answer to these questions because each state is different.,anti-guns
"In well developed countries such as Australia and Japan, strict gun control laws are effective at reducing the amount of yearly deaths.",anti-guns
